		"title": "Modi-Factor Continues To Steam Roll Everyone in 2024",
		"text": "New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, managed to draw the year to a close on a magnum opus knockout electoral victory. A historic win in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections and a sweeping victory in by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh has once again proved that the political landscape in India remains firmly under the spell of PM Narendra Modi and his party, the BJP. As the last electoral battle of this year concluded on Saturday, the 'Modi factor' once again proved to be the defining force of the 2024 electoral verdicts, which continued to reshape the nation's political narrative.\n\nAs a series of state and Lok Sabha elections conducted throughout the year, PM Modi's leadership kept dominating the nation’s political landscape, leading people to speculate whether anyone would be able to challenge his leadership and would be able to resist his growing impact on the large population in and outside the country.\n\nStarting with the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly election, the BJP went to electoral battle in eight states with the support of its allies as the NDA in 2024 and ended the year’s record by registering a thumping 6-2 victory. Apart from Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA managed to win the Assembly elections in six states with a comfortable margin including the states like Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Haryana and Maharashtra.\n\nFrom Andhra Pradesh to Haryana, from Maharashtra to Odisha, the influence of the Prime Minister has been felt across the geographical stretch of India. Even as the Congress, regional parties, and other opposition alliances attempted to challenge him, his party, BJP's performance consistently outpaced expectations, leaving political experts and analysts to eventually call the electoral results a clear testament to PM Modi’s power of spreading popularity.\n\nModi-Factor Secured Record-Breaking 3rd Term in General Elections\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha elections, held in April and May, were indefinitely the biggest political event this year. This year’s general election witnessed a clear continuation of the BJP's dominance under Prime Minister Modi at the national level after he led the party to a record third consecutive term at the Centre and subsequently took charge as the Prime Minister for the third time, a feat unparalleled in Indian political history in the post-independence era.\n\nThe BJP-led NDA, aided by a combination of strong messaging on national security, development, and economic growth, secured a mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, winning 293 seats in the lower house of Parliament. PM Modi's campaign, marked by a focus on \"New India,\" economic reforms, and national pride, resonated with a broad population of voters, from urban professionals to rural communities, and won the BJP 240 seats alone.\n\nNot only the BJP but if the political analysts are to be believed, PM Modi’s wave, despite a negative promotional agenda by the Opposition parties on the Constitution and the caste, helped the allies as well in outnumbering other political parties in their respective states. The BJP-ally the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won 16 seats, the Janata Dal (United) won 12 seats, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena won 7 seats and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) won 5 seats.\n\nThe opposition parties repeatedly failed to mount a significant challenge, despite several attempts to unite under a \"grand alliance\". Even regional powerhouses like Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal and Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were unable to pose a significant challenge at the national level before the Modi factor.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that, despite, several accomplishments in the kitty, including, the abrogation of Article 370, the construction of Ram Mandir, the much-talked-about government's foreign policies, and various government schemes, the BJP chose to push the narrative in the name of PM Modi, citing “MODI KI GUARANTEE”.\n\nEarlier, in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP secured a thumping majority, by securing 282 and 303 seats respectively.\n\nModi-Factor In Assembly Elections\n\nThis year, the country witnessed Assembly elections in as many as seven states and one Union Territory, including Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir respectively. The BJP-led NDA managed to win six out of eight of them:\n\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister, Pema Khandu. In Sikkim, the BJP ally Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) has its government under Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang. In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP-led NDA is ruling the state under TDP Chief and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. In Odisha, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi. In Haryana, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini. In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti is all set to form the new government.\n\nThe statistics indicate that the momentum created by the Modi-factor continued to spill over into the state assembly elections and the Lok Sabha elections throughout the year. In states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Maharashtra, the BJP continued to perform exceptionally well, while in Odisha, the party took over the charge creating history. While in the other two states, the BJP allies formed the government in support of the party and formed the government.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP alliance, Mahayuti, emerged victorious in the state assembly elections, securing a mandate that appeared unassailable despite the challenges posed by the MVA parties, including the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP(SP). The saffron party's win here was seen as a significant blow to the Congress and its allies, including Uddhav Thackeray’s party, which had been considered a formidable force in the state.\n\nOpposition Struggles to Find a Foothold\n\nPolitical analysts feel that a weak opposition against PM Modi, has been continuously making his job quite consistent and smooth. On the other hand, despite the sweeping victories for a few years, the opposition has failed to corner the BJP and Prime Minister Modi on various issues. The Congress and other parties have repeatedly pointed out issues such as unemployment, economic disparities, and growing religious polarisation as evidence that PM Modi's tenure has been far from flawless.\n\nThe experts, however, feel that despite these criticisms and picking issues against the ruling party and the government, the opposition has struggled to present a credible alternative to PM Modi before the voters.\n\nThe formation of various alliances - such as the \"Mahagathbandhan\" in Bihar or efforts to unite anti-BJP forces in Uttar Pradesh - or efforts to unite the entire political parties against the BJP on one platform under a new alliance called INDI Alliance - failed to match the BJP's organisational strength and PM Modi’s personal appeal.\n\nNot only stature, but the opposition parties have also been unable to match the BJP’s campaign machinery, which remains one of the most formidable in the world, making the party, the world’s largest political party. Additionally, the Opposition, appears, to lack the thought process in picking issues against PM Modi, which will work in their favour in cornering the prime minister. So far, the track record shows that the issues picked by the Opposition against PM Modi have felt flat on most of the occasions.\n\nWill There be Rival to the Modi Factor?\n\nThe dominance of the Modi factor appears unlikely to wane in the near future. The BJP's electoral expertise is in full swing, and its national and state strategies continue to finely connect with the voters. Above all this, the continued absence of a united and credible opposition against PM Modi remains the most glaring challenge before them in a vast and competitive democratic process like India.\n\nIn 2024, as the electoral battle settles for the year, one thing is clear Narendra Modi and the BJP remain the players in the spotlight in Indian politics. Whether this dominance will extend into the next decade or whether a new challenger will rise remains the key question for Indian politics.",

		"title": "'It Dried Out Fairly Quick': Unforeseen Pitch Dynamics Leave AUS Coach McDonald Surprised On Day 2",
		"text": "The home team bowlers did not put a foot wrong but the pi\" dried up quite quickly at the Optus stadium on the second day, eventually helping the Indian batters, reckons Australia head coach Andrew McDonald.\n\nIndia openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (90) and KL Rahul (62) frustrated the hosts with their dogged unbeaten 172-run stand that has put the game in firm control of the visitors, who now lead by 218 runs.\n\nWhile the wickets fell in heap on the opening day with as many as 17 batters getting out, only three Australian tail-enders were dismissed on the second day. \"The surface looked considerably dry today. It dried out fairly quickly,\" said McDonald during the post-day press conference.\n\n\"We thought there may have been a little bit more there. So, I suppose if you want to say that we were a little bit surprised, yeah, there wasn't as much seam movement or swing.\n\n\"The bowlers were presenting the seam in a similar fashion to they were yesterday. So I think the conditions may have had some say in that.\" McDonald said there was hardly any assistance for seam or swing, compared to the first day.\n\n\"If you look at the seam and swing, it was down comparative to yesterday. Yesterday was difficult work, I thought KL (Rahul) and Jaiswal played extremely well also.\n\n\"You need to ride your luck a little bit. Our guys got the balls in the right areas, and there was some plays and misses as well, so anything can happen if you get some edges on that. It could be a totally different day, but I think the conditions have changed, I'll state that,\" he said.\n\n\"In terms of the way that we bowled, I don't think it was too dissimilar, potentially early on we may have been a fraction short, if it was to be critical, but I thought they went about their work well, it could have been a different day.\" However, McDonald does not think Australia do not stand a chance in the series-opener, pinning hopes on the nature of Test cricket that keeps both the teams in hunt till the end.\n\n\"You've got the driver's seat at the moment, but that's not to say that tomorrow can't change very quickly. Test cricket ebbs and flows, we've all been a part of a game when you've been well ahead of the game and it can twist and turn, so we've got to get to work on what it looks like for us tomorrow morning,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about 20 odd overs to the second new ball, we've got to work out a way to navigate through a few batters before that second new ball arrives and that could be our entry point back into the game.\" He though admitted that they have to \"get tactics right\".\n\n\"If we're too aggressive then the scoreboard runs and then you put yourself right up against it. So it's a real combination about controlling the tempo of the game and creating opportunities within that.\" From the situation that India have batted themselves into, it is real a possibility that the hosts maybe looking at stiff chase of beyond 400 but McDonald would prefer not to look that far ahead.\n\n\"We're not looking that far ahead, we've got 10 wickets to take first, so that's our first focus. No, no targets, clearly 10 wickets to get, first priority, then we'll move from there.\" Talking about the frantic first day, the Australia coach admitted that it could be due to the nerves the players of both the teams felt due to the occasion.\n\n\"No doubt both the teams would have had some nerves there leading into a big series, so there might have been some error on the back of that, but I think as a batting unit when you get a look at a wicket and then obviously your bowlers go about their work and you get a second up opportunity, I think it looks a little bit different in terms of your mindset, your knowing what to expect and you can work from there.\" McDonald also backed Marnus Labuschagne, who consumed 52 balls for his two runs in the first innings.\n\n\"He's working his game as hard as ever. There's no doubt he can learn some lessons from the first innings, like I think both teams' batters.",

		"text": "The opening match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy saw Team India exert dominance as they tame Australia at the Optus Stadium in Perth. After bundling Australia at 104, the Men in Blue continued their lead in their innings as Team India openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal looked in form against the Australian bowling arsenal. The Indian opening batters remained unbeaten and dominant at the end of Day 2 in Perth. Notably, Yashasvi looked daring as he went against the Aussie attack.\n\nYashasvi Jaiswal & Marnus Labuschagne Go Back And Forth During IND vs AUS Day 2 Play | WATCH\n\nAs the play progressed during the India vs Australia match-up at the Optus Stadium, a hilarious moment ensued between India star Yashasvi Jaiswal and Australia's Marnus Labuschagne, who was on fielding duty. While Jaiswal returned to the non-striker's end, Labuschagne picked the ball and performed a fake throw towards the stumps to trigger a reaction from the India opener.\n\nBut Yashasvi Jaiswal did not fall to Marnus Labuschagne's mind games and instead had a hilarious response to his tricks. The India opener stood outside the crease and asked Marnus to aim for the stumps. The batter tried to tempt the Aussie cricket on hitting the stumps. The banter went on for some seconds as the day two play progressed at Australia's Optus Stadium in Perth.\n\nSpeaking of the match, after skipper Jasprit Bumrah's game-changing 11th five-wicket haul decimated Australia for 104, Yashavi Jaiswal and seasoned Rahul decided to grind it out with some old-fashioned Test match batting by waiting for the loose deliveries and respecting good fast bowling.\n\nYashasvi Jaiswal combined game awareness with perfect shot selection, while KL Rahul remained technically unflappable in an unbroken opening stand of 172 as India looked set to bat Australia out of the match with an overall lead of 218 runs on the second day of the opening Test match at the Optus Stadium in Perth. The Indian batters showed their compact defense by scoring 88 runs in 31 overs during the post-tea session as Jaiswal inched towards a coveted ton on his maiden outing on Australian soil.",

The mega auction will decide how all the 10 franchises shape up for the next three years and his they can find out a way to win the IPL title. The eighteenth edition of the Indian Premier League is rumoured to begin on March 14 with the final possibly to be played on May 25. A total sum of INR 641.50 crore might be spent by all the 10 franchises to fill up 204 slots.\n\nAlmost 70 slots have been reserved for the overseas players in 10 teams. Franchises like Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Delhi Capitals, Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants are looking for skippers and this will spice up the contest even more. Here's a look at all the 10 IPL Franchises and how their purse looks like, ahead of the mega auctions.\n\n1. Punjab Kings: Auction Purse of Rs. 110.5 Crore\n\nJust like every other auction, Punjab Kings aka PBKS have the biggest purse. Punjab have taken the lesser travelled route and have retained only two uncapped players in Shashank Sharma and Prabhsimran Singh. The Punjab-based franchise will be the busiest on the auction table and they'll build the entire team from the scratch.\n\n2. Royal Challengers Bengaluru: Auction Purse of Rs. 83 Crore\n\nPunjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are the two franchises that have never won the IPL despite playing in the finals. RCB surprised everybody with just three retentions, Virat Kohli (capped), Rajat Patidar (capped) and Yash Dayal (uncapped). The franchise synonymous with Kohli will also have many slots to fill and oversee that their core remains stable for the next three years.\n\n3. Delhi Capitals: Auction Purse of Rs. 73 Crore\n\nThe finalists of IPL 2020, Delhi Capitals surprised everybody as they let go of their captain Rishabh Pant. Delhi retained only four players in the form of Axar Patel (capped), Kuldeep Yadav (capped), Tristan Stubbs (capped)and Abhishek Porel (uncapped).\n\n4. Lucknow Super Giants: Purse of Rs. 69 Crore\n\nLucknow Super Giants are fairly new to the IPL setup and have already played two playoffs in three years. The team did thrive under KL Rahul, but however he was not retained by the franchise. The Lucknow-based franchise retained Nicholas Pooran (capped), Ravi Bishnoi (capped), Mayank Yadav (capped), Ayush Badoni (uncapped) and Mohsin Khan (uncapped). Lucknow will need a captain if they do not want Pooran to lead the side.\n\n5. Gujarat Titans: Purse of Rs. 69 Crore",

		"text": "It does not matter if Ding Liren is struggling for form or is at his best, D Gukesh knows he needs to be the \"best version of himself \" in every game against the Chinese during the World Chess Championship clash, starting Monday.\n\nWhile Gukesh has been in fine touch, Liren has struggled in the lead-up to the prestigious event.\n\n\"For me, it's pretty clear who I'm going to face. I'm going to face Ding Liren, who has been one of the best players in the world for more than a decade,\" said Gukesh, who will play with whites in the opening game, said at the pre-tournament press conference.\n\n\"My job is also pretty clear—just go into every game as the best version of myself and play the best moves in the position. If I do that, if I keep playing good chess and stay in the right spirits, even with his recent form dip or even at his best, I don't think it really matters.\n\n\"If I do the right things, I'm confident I have all the chances in the world,\" he added.\n\nThis year's tournament marks the first time in 138 years that two Asian players will pitted against each other in the World Chess Championship, that is offering a prize fund of USD 2.5 million.\n\n\"It's an honour and privilege to play for India in any event, especially something as significant as the World Championship. Representing my country and carrying the hopes of Indians is something I take very seriously,\" Gukesh said.\n\nAcknowledging the nerves ahead of the big event, the 18-year-old from Chennai said, “I won’t say I’m super calm. I know this is a big event, and I’m super excited. But I also know I can handle any nerves. As long as I’m confident in my skills, I don’t have anything to worry about.”\n\nPreparation and coach’s influence\n\nGukesh revealed he has been focused on the championship since qualifying.\n\n\"Since the moment I qualified for the match, it has been the main thing on my mind. Me and my team, we prepared in the best way possible.\n\n\"My trainer is here with me and all my other team members. I think we all did a great job. I'm super happy with my preparation. Now it's all about doing the right things and using that preparation.\" Paying a glowing tribute to his coach Grzegorz Gajewski, Gukesh said, \"We started working together in December 2022. Initially, it was on a tournament basis, but we had some great experiences and decided to partner full-time.\" \"He's had a huge influence on me, especially in broadening my approach to chess. I was a very narrow-minded chess player. He opened me up to many different approaches and ideas.\n\n\"My openings and other aspects of the game have improved a lot over the last couple of years. Other than my parents, he is simply the biggest influence on my chess.\" He also emphasized the role of fitness in his preparation.\n\n\"I always like to do some physical exercise. Specially for World Championships, I have been working with Paddy Upton, who has helped me with my fitness. I played some sports regularly, did some yoga, some workouts, so happy with everything.\" World Number one Magnus Carlsen of Norway had said in the past that he doesn't enjoy the months of preparation required for the world chess championship.\n\nAsked if he enjoyed the preparation process, Gukesh said, \"Magnus Carlsen has been doing this for close to 10 years, but this is my first World Championship. It's all new for me, so it's easier to enjoy and be excited. I love chess, and I’ve learned so much over the last few months.\" “For sure there has to be some hard work done, but I love chess, I'm learning something new, I've learned a lot of things in these last months and I'm very happy with the preparations, and I was also able to enjoy it very much.”\n\nLiren on his form and the challenge\n\nAcknowledging his recent struggles, Liren said he is reviewing his recent performances to have best preparation for the clash.\n\n\"Yesterday I reviewed my games from recent times. The quality was not so good. I can see very low. Also, my fighting spirit is not so high.\" \"I made many short draws. I also drew even winning some much better positions. I don't know if that is the reason behind it. But it's not far from my peak performance.",

Matrize has predicted a clear victory for Mahayuti while P-MARQ has also given an edge to the BJP -led alliance. Whoever wins Maharashtra, would have won the mood and the narrative. However, if the mandate is fractured on the result day, Ajit Pawar -led NCP — a breakaway faction of the Sharad Pawar -led NCP, may be the first one to ditch the Mahayuti. If this happens, then it can lead to a re-accumulation of the post-poll alliances. In Jharkhand, most exit polls have predicted a win for the BJP-NDA, baring one, which is Axis My India, as it has predicted a victory for the INDIA Bloc. Now, Jharkhand is important, very important, but not more than Maharashtra at the national level. Jharkhand is completely unclear, nobody except Axis My India, is fully sticking their neck out. Besides Assembly elections, this round of elections saw bypolls on 9 seats in Uttar Pradesh among others. As per the narrative setting, people will also be looking at Uttar Pradesh, where exit polls have predicted 7 out of 9 seats in the favour of the BJP. In this round of the UP bypolls, it’s going to be a test for CM Yogi’s ‘Batenge Toh Katenge’ narrative.\n\nMaharashtra Assembly elections on all the 288 seats were conducted today, November 20 in one single phase while Jharkhand voted in two phases on November 13 and 20. Jharkhand has a total of 81 seats.\n\nIn Maharashtra, Mahayuti comprising of the BJP, Eknath Shinde -led Shiv Sena, Ajit Pawar's NCP fought a closely contested elections against Maha Vikas Aghadi consisting of Congress , Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar's NCP. The counting of votes in both the states is set for November 23, Saturday.",

		"text": "New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, managed to draw the year to a close on a magnum opus knockout electoral victory. A historic win in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections and a sweeping victory in by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh has once again proved that the political landscape in India remains firmly under the spell of PM Narendra Modi and his party, the BJP. As the last electoral battle of this year concluded on Saturday, the 'Modi factor' once again proved to be the defining force of the 2024 electoral verdicts, which continued to reshape the nation's political narrative.\n\nAs a series of state and Lok Sabha elections conducted throughout the year, PM Modi's leadership kept dominating the nation’s political landscape, leading people to speculate whether anyone would be able to challenge his leadership and would be able to resist his growing impact on the large population in and outside the country.\n\nStarting with the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly election, the BJP went to electoral battle in eight states with the support of its allies as the NDA in 2024 and ended the year’s record by registering a thumping 6-2 victory. Apart from Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA managed to win the Assembly elections in six states with a comfortable margin including the states like Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Haryana and Maharashtra.\n\nFrom Andhra Pradesh to Haryana, from Maharashtra to Odisha, the influence of the Prime Minister has been felt across the geographical stretch of India. Even as the Congress, regional parties, and other opposition alliances attempted to challenge him, his party, BJP's performance consistently outpaced expectations, leaving political experts and analysts to eventually call the electoral results a clear testament to PM Modi’s power of spreading popularity.\n\nModi-Factor Secured Record-Breaking 3rd Term in General Elections\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha elections, held in April and May, were indefinitely the biggest political event this year. This year’s general election witnessed a clear continuation of the BJP's dominance under Prime Minister Modi at the national level after he led the party to a record third consecutive term at the Centre and subsequently took charge as the Prime Minister for the third time, a feat unparalleled in Indian political history in the post-independence era.\n\nThe BJP-led NDA, aided by a combination of strong messaging on national security, development, and economic growth, secured a mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, winning 293 seats in the lower house of Parliament. PM Modi's campaign, marked by a focus on \"New India,\" economic reforms, and national pride, resonated with a broad population of voters, from urban professionals to rural communities, and won the BJP 240 seats alone.\n\nNot only the BJP but if the political analysts are to be believed, PM Modi’s wave, despite a negative promotional agenda by the Opposition parties on the Constitution and the caste, helped the allies as well in outnumbering other political parties in their respective states. The BJP-ally the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won 16 seats, the Janata Dal (United) won 12 seats, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena won 7 seats and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) won 5 seats.\n\nThe opposition parties repeatedly failed to mount a significant challenge, despite several attempts to unite under a \"grand alliance\". Even regional powerhouses like Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal and Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were unable to pose a significant challenge at the national level before the Modi factor.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that, despite, several accomplishments in the kitty, including, the abrogation of Article 370, the construction of Ram Mandir, the much-talked-about government's foreign policies, and various government schemes, the BJP chose to push the narrative in the name of PM Modi, citing “MODI KI GUARANTEE”.\n\nEarlier, in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP secured a thumping majority, by securing 282 and 303 seats respectively.\n\nModi-Factor In Assembly Elections\n\nThis year, the country witnessed Assembly elections in as many as seven states and one Union Territory, including Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir respectively. The BJP-led NDA managed to win six out of eight of them:\n\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister, Pema Khandu. In Sikkim, the BJP ally Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) has its government under Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang. In Andhra Pradesh, the BJP-led NDA is ruling the state under TDP Chief and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. In Odisha, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi. In Haryana, the BJP has its government under Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini. In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti is all set to form the new government.\n\nThe statistics indicate that the momentum created by the Modi-factor continued to spill over into the state assembly elections and the Lok Sabha elections throughout the year. In states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Maharashtra, the BJP continued to perform exceptionally well, while in Odisha, the party took over the charge creating history. While in the other two states, the BJP allies formed the government in support of the party and formed the government.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP alliance, Mahayuti, emerged victorious in the state assembly elections, securing a mandate that appeared unassailable despite the challenges posed by the MVA parties, including the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP(SP). The saffron party's win here was seen as a significant blow to the Congress and its allies, including Uddhav Thackeray’s party, which had been considered a formidable force in the state.\n\nOpposition Struggles to Find a Foothold\n\nPolitical analysts feel that a weak opposition against PM Modi, has been continuously making his job quite consistent and smooth. On the other hand, despite the sweeping victories for a few years, the opposition has failed to corner the BJP and Prime Minister Modi on various issues. The Congress and other parties have repeatedly pointed out issues such as unemployment, economic disparities, and growing religious polarisation as evidence that PM Modi's tenure has been far from flawless.\n\nThe experts, however, feel that despite these criticisms and picking issues against the ruling party and the government, the opposition has struggled to present a credible alternative to PM Modi before the voters.\n\nThe formation of various alliances - such as the \"Mahagathbandhan\" in Bihar or efforts to unite anti-BJP forces in Uttar Pradesh - or efforts to unite the entire political parties against the BJP on one platform under a new alliance called INDI Alliance - failed to match the BJP's organisational strength and PM Modi’s personal appeal.\n\nNot only stature, but the opposition parties have also been unable to match the BJP’s campaign machinery, which remains one of the most formidable in the world, making the party, the world’s largest political party. Additionally, the Opposition, appears, to lack the thought process in picking issues against PM Modi, which will work in their favour in cornering the prime minister. So far, the track record shows that the issues picked by the Opposition against PM Modi have felt flat on most of the occasions.\n\nWill There be Rival to the Modi Factor?\n\nThe dominance of the Modi factor appears unlikely to wane in the near future. The BJP's electoral expertise is in full swing, and its national and state strategies continue to finely connect with the voters. Above all this, the continued absence of a united and credible opposition against PM Modi remains the most glaring challenge before them in a vast and competitive democratic process like India.\n\nIn 2024, as the electoral battle settles for the year, one thing is clear Narendra Modi and the BJP remain the players in the spotlight in Indian politics. Whether this dominance will extend into the next decade or whether a new challenger will rise remains the key question for Indian politics.",

		"title": "India Launches First Ever Space Defence Exercise ‘Antariksha Abhyas’ to Secure National Interests",
		"text": "New Delhi, India - The Indian military embarked on a new frontier of defence strategy with the commencement of the ‘Antariksha Abhyas – 2024’, a pioneering three-day space exercise being conducted by the Defence Space Agency (DSA) from 11 to 13 November 2024. This first-of-its-kind exercise is aimed at war-gaming the growing threats to and from space-based assets and services. It is a critical step toward securing India’s national strategic objectives in space and integrating its burgeoning space capabilities into military operations.\n\nIn his opening address, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan underscored the importance of space in modern defence. “Space, once considered the final frontier, is now the critical enabler of India’s defence and security apparatus,” he stated. Highlighting the dynamic and evolving nature of space, he said, “With its rich legacy of space exploration and growing military capabilities, India is well-positioned to navigate the challenges posed to space-based capabilities.”\n\nThe exercise is being conducted under the aegis of Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff, with active participation from the Defence Space Agency and its allied units, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Notably, specialized branches such as the Defence Cyber Agency, Defence Intelligence Agency, and Strategic Forces Command are also partaking in the event. Additionally, experts from the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) and the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) are contributing their insights to enhance the exercise's operational scope.\n\nAims and Objectives of the Exercise\n\nThe primary objective of Antariksha Abhyas – 2024 is to deepen the understanding of the operational dependencies on space-based assets and services, as well as the vulnerabilities in case of disruptions to these services. The growing reliance on satellite communications, navigation, intelligence gathering, and reconnaissance makes space a crucial domain for modern warfare. As space becomes increasingly congested, contested, competitive, and commercial, the exercise will focus on evaluating how space-based systems can be protected and integrated into military operations.\n\nGeneral Chauhan, in his address, stressed that space is no longer a peaceful domain but one that is rapidly becoming an arena of contention. The CDS highlighted the importance of fostering innovation and developing cutting-edge technologies in collaboration with DRDO, ISRO, and academia to ensure that India’s space-based capabilities remain resilient in the face of emerging threats.\n\nExercise Focus Areas\n\nThe exercise will explore several critical areas:\n\nUnderstanding Space-Based Asset Dependency: Participants will examine the operational reliance on space assets such as satellites for communication, navigation, surveillance, and targeting. This understanding is crucial to ensure that military operations remain effective, even under the threat of space-based disruptions. Identifying Vulnerabilities in Space Operations: A significant component of the exercise will involve identifying potential vulnerabilities in conducting military operations if space-based services are denied or disrupted. These could include the denial of satellite communications, GPS, or reconnaissance systems. Collaboration Across Agencies: A multi-agency collaboration, including the DSA, DRDO, ISRO, and various branches of the Indian Armed Forces, will aim to bolster joint operations in space. This collaboration is essential to integrate military strategies with national space capabilities. Scenario-Based War-Gaming: The exercise will feature a simulation of space conflict scenarios where space assets may be targeted or disrupted. The aim is to assess the preparedness of India’s defence apparatus in countering such threats and ensure continuity of operations. Fostering Innovation in Space Technologies: In line with General Chauhan’s emphasis, the exercise will also focus on exploring innovative solutions for protecting and enhancing space-based assets. Collaboration between the military and India’s civilian space agencies will be key to developing next-generation space defence technologies.\n\nA Step Toward Securing Space Assets\n\nThe successful conduct of Antariksha Abhyas – 2024 will pave the way for future exercises and a structured approach to space warfare readiness. The Indian military’s growing recognition of space as a domain of potential conflict reflects global trends, as other major powers also increasingly militarize space.\n\nGeneral Chauhan’s remarks echoed the necessity of securing space-based capabilities in an era where satellite systems play a pivotal role in intelligence gathering, communications, and even the operational success of modern military forces. As adversaries also enhance their space capabilities, it becomes essential for India to establish a robust space defence strategy, not only to defend national assets but also to deter any potential threats in space.\n\nParticipants and Stakeholders\n\nAntariksha Abhyas – 2024 sees a large range of stakeholders actively participating:\n\nDefence Space Agency (DSA): Leading the exercise, with personnel from DSA and allied units.\n\nIndian Armed Forces: Representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nDefence Cyber Agency: Addressing cybersecurity concerns related to space operations.\n\nDefence Intelligence Agency: Providing insights into space intelligence and its integration into military operations.\n\nStrategic Forces Command: Participating in operational scenarios involving India’s nuclear assets and their link to space-based capabilities.\n\nISRO and DRDO: Playing a critical role in the technological and research aspects of the exercise.\n\nThe Path Ahead\n\nAs Antariksha Abhyas – 2024 progresses, it marks a crucial step toward solidifying India’s position in the growing realm of space security. This exercise will not only strengthen India’s defence posture but also ensure that its space-based assets are secured against evolving threats. As space continues to be an essential enabler of military power, India’s focus on its integration into defence operations demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to safeguarding national interests in the space domain.",

		"text": "Colombo, Sri Lanka – The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Sri Lanka Coast Guard (SLCG) held the 7th Annual High-Level Meeting today in Colombo, underscoring the shared commitment of both maritime forces toward addressing regional security and maritime challenges. This year’s meeting was led by a four-member ICG delegation, headed by Director General S. Paramesh, alongside the SLCG delegation led by Director General Rear Admiral Y.R. Serasinghe. The annual meeting marked a significant milestone in cooperative maritime efforts between the two nations and the ongoing collaboration between their coast guards.\n\nThe high-level discussions centred on key maritime issues facing the region, with both Coast Guards agreeing to strengthen collaboration in areas such as anti-drug trafficking operations, marine pollution control, mariner safety, capacity-building programs, and the adoption of best practices. Both delegations highlighted the importance of addressing these pressing issues with an enhanced cooperative approach, reiterating a joint commitment to uphold the security, safety, and environmental health of their shared waters.\n\nThe meeting further reviewed the outcomes of previous cooperative efforts and outlined steps for enhancing existing protocols, training, and operational exercises.\n\nStrengthening Maritime Safety Through Cooperation\n\nBoth delegations emphasized the need to share real-time intelligence to bolster their abilities to respond swiftly to maritime threats. This includes drug trafficking—a persistent issue in the region—where both India and Sri Lanka have committed to cooperating closely to track and curb the flow of illegal narcotics through maritime channels. Enhanced measures for preventing marine pollution were also a central theme, with both Coast Guards working toward implementing more stringent control and response protocols to minimize environmental damage.\n\nIn line with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two agencies in May 2018, this institutionalized annual meeting ensures that both Coast Guards continue to engage on critical maritime matters and work collaboratively on solutions. The MoU provides a framework for mutual support, regular exchange programs, and coordinated operations, reflecting the strategic alignment between India and Sri Lanka in the maritime domain.\n\nEnhanced Regional Stability and Preparedness\n\nThe ICG and SLCG concluded the meeting with renewed commitments to further strengthen mutual support mechanisms and collaborative arrangements. These measures include joint training initiatives, search and rescue exercises, and further standardization of protocols for shared maritime responsibilities.",

		"title": "Indo-Russian Defence Partnership Expands with BDL-Rosoboronexport MoU on Pantsir Systems",
		"text": "Goa, India – Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), a leading defence manufacturing company in India, announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Russia’s Rosoboronexport (ROE) to collaborate on the Pantsir air defence missile-gun systems. The agreement, a significant milestone in Indo-Russian defence cooperation, was formalized by BDL’s Chairman and Managing Director, Cmde A Madhavarao (Retd), and ROE’s Deputy Director General of the Naval Department, Kovalenko German, at the 5th India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission (IRIGC) subgroup meeting in Goa .\n\nIn an official post on X (formerly Twitter), BDL stated, “Bharat Dynamics Limited and Rosoboronexport (ROE), Russia entered into MoU for cooperation on Pantsir variants, air defence missile-gun system. The MoU was signed by Cmde A Madhavarao, (Retd), CMD, BDL and Mr Kovalenko German, DDG, Naval Dept, ROE on the sidelines of the 5th IRIGC Subgroup at Goa.”\n\nAbout the Pantsir-S1 System\n\nThe Pantsir-S1 system, central to this MoU, is a sophisticated short-range air defence system combining missile and gun capabilities to counter multiple aerial threats. Described by Rosoboronexport as \"perfect protection for any object,\" the system is designed for the air defence of military, industrial, and administrative facilities. It is capable of defending against various air threats, including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, cruise missiles, and high-precision weapons.\n\nThe Pantsir-S1 system offers a range of operational capabilities, such as:\n\nEngagement Range: Engages targets from 1,200 to 20,000 meters using missiles, and 200 to 4,000 meters with guns.\n\nAltitude Range: Missile altitude engagement from 15 to 15,000 meters; gun altitude range from 0 to 3,000 meters.\n\nMulti-Target Capability: Simultaneously engages up to four targets, capable of intercepting objects moving at speeds of up to 1,000 meters per second.\n\nStrengthening Indo-Russian Defence Relations\n\nThe MoU with Rosoboronexport aligns with India’s strategic defence partnership with Russia, building on high-profile projects like the S-400 Triumf air defence missile system. The S-400 agreement, managed by Rostec State Corporation, marked a major achievement in Indo-Russian military cooperation, becoming one of the largest defence contracts in Russia’s history. At the time of the signing, Sergey Chemezov, Head of Rostec, stated, “The S-400 supply agreement with India is a new landmark in the history of military-technical cooperation between our countries. The deal demonstrates the highest level of trust and understanding between India and Russia.”\n\nRosoboronexport reiterated this sentiment, labeling the S-400 acquisition as a “biggest-ever deal” for the company. This ongoing partnership underscores India’s commitment to enhancing its defence systems through Russian technology, cementing a robust framework of defence collaboration between the two nations.\n\nIndia’s Pursuit of Advanced Air Defence\n\nIndia’s collaboration with Russia on the Pantsir-S1 follows an increased focus on bolstering its air defence capabilities. Recently, the Indian Army issued a Request for Information (RFI) for carrier air defence tracked (CADET) vehicles, reflecting India’s drive to enhance protection for mobile ground units. Such initiatives align with the country’s broader strategy to upgrade its short-range and medium-range air defence systems, particularly in light of new-age aerial threats.\n\nThe BDL-Rosoboronexport MoU represents India’s effort to integrate versatile and technologically advanced defence systems. The Pantsir-S1’s combination of missile and gun technology, high target engagement speed, and multi-target capabilities are expected to complement existing air defence assets, providing a layered, multi-faceted shield for India’s military installations.\n\nA Strategic Step Forward in Defence Diplomacy\n\nThis MoU represents more than just a defence collaboration; it is a strategic move that strengthens diplomatic ties and enhances mutual trust between India and Russia. With both nations exploring shared security interests in the face of evolving global threats, the partnership exemplifies India’s pursuit of strategic autonomy in defence capabilities.",

		"text": "A two-year-old Mpox patient lying in the epicentre of this viral disease in Congo. | Image: AP\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has approved the first mpox vaccine meant for children, a decision that's expected to fasten the pace of immunization among one of the worst hit populations as a result of this ongoing outbreak induced by this viral infectious disease in Congo, and in Africa.\n\nexperts hope will help make immunizations more widely available to one of the hardest-hit populations during the ongoing outbreaks of the disease in Congo and elsewhere in Africa.\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, the U.N. health agency said it had approved the mpox vaccine made by Japanese company KM Biologics for use in children over 1 year of age as a single dose.\n\nEarlier this month, the charity Save the Children said cases among children younger than 18 had increased by more than 130 per cent in Congo, noting there were now more than 25,000 suspect cases.\n\nThe charity said children were almost four times more likely than adults to die from the newest form of mpox first detected in eastern Congo earlier this year. Mpox, related to smallpox, mostly causes symptoms including fever, rash, lesions and fatigue.\n\n“Children are especially vulnerable to mpox,” Save The Children’s Dr. Katia Veira de Moraaes Lecasse said in a statement. “They explore by touch and taste, don’t always understand health guidance and have weaker immune systems than adults.”\n\nA health worker attends a Mpox patient. Image credit: AP\n\nCongo's battle with Mpox\n\nScientists have previously noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in Congo and Burundi, which account for more than 90 per cent of all mpox cases in Africa’s current outbreak.\n\nWHO had previously approved the mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic for people 18 and over but said the shot could be used in younger populations if doctors thought the benefits might outweigh potential risks, given the lack of data in children and other groups including pregnant women.\n\nLast week, WHO said cases of mpox in the Congolese region where the new, more infectious form was first identified appeared to be “plateauing,” even as cases were rising elsewhere, including Burundi and Uganda.\n\nSo far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox with the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\n\nWHO said Japan had announced it would donate about 3 million doses of the shot made by KM Biologics to Congo. It was not clear whether any of the doses have arrived.\n\nOn Friday, WHO is convening its expert committee to determine whether the outbreaks in Congo and elsewhere in Africa is still a global emergency, a declaration the U.N. agency first made in August.",

But before you dive into that piping hot plate of chaat or slurp up some golgappa, you might want to ask yourself: Could this delish dish make me sick? Here’s a sassy rundown of five popular Indian street foods and whether they could leave you clutching your stomach later.\n\nPani puri. image credit: Pinterest\n\nPani puri\n\nIt’s love at first bite—crispy puris stuffed with tangy water, potatoes, and chickpeas. But that “pani” could be the villain. If the water isn’t filtered properly or the vendor’s hygiene isn’t up to snuff, it could cause some serious stomach havoc. Bottom line: Don’t skip the street-side stall with a questionable crowd.\n\nPav bhaji. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nPav bhaji\n\nA sizzling plate of butter-laden pav with spicy mashed veggies? Yum! But if that butter has been sitting out too long in the sun or the veggies aren’t fresh, your stomach could revolt. Always go for the stalls with a crowd of loyal patrons—fresh ingredients are key.\n\nSamosas. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nSamosas\n\nWe all love a hot samosa, but if it's been sitting under a glass case for hours, chances are it's harbouring bacteria. Deep-fried food tends to get soggy and unsafe when reheated, and that filling might not be as fresh as you think.\n\nChaat. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nChaat\n\nFrom bhel puri to dahi puri, chaat is a perfect mix of textures and flavors. But raw veggies, chutneys, and yogurt can quickly become breeding grounds for bacteria. So, if your chaat looks like it's been sitting out too long, you might want to skip it.\n\nKathi rolls.

You must be aware that sitting at your desk all day long can increase your risk of heart disease, a risk that even a workout can’t undo, according to new research.\n\n“Our findings really emphasize the importance of avoiding excess sitting… whether or not you’re physically active,” Dr Ezim Ajufo, the study’s lead author and a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, told a leading media house.\n\n90,000 people were examined\n\n<i>(Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nAs per the study published on Friday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, nearly 90,000 people were examined by researchers who analyzed data from an accelerometer worn by participants for a week. The researchers compared the participants’ sedentary and active time with later diagnoses of conditions like stroke, heart attack, and heart failure.\n\nThe finding not only revealed the link between sedentary behaviour and the risk of future cardiovascular disease but also showed guidelines about what may count as sitting too much.\n\n“We would really recommend that as many people as possible avoid sitting more than 10.6 hours a day,” Ajufo said. “That’s not a hard and fast threshold, but we think it’s a reasonable first step for guidelines and public health intervention.”\n\n<i>(Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nHow to get moving?",

The city is often engulfed in smog, reducing visibility and affecting health.\n\nWhat is Smog?\n\nWinter smog forms when the thin layer of atmosphere close to the Earth’s surface becomes cooler than the layers above it. According to London Air, this phenomenon is known as temperature inversion.\n\nDuring a temperature inversion, pollutants become trapped at ground level until weather conditions shift.\n\n<i>(Smog Season. Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nHow is winter smog harmful?\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) warns that winter smog poses several health risks, including eye irritation, throat issues, and even cancer. NIH explains, “It can irritate our eyes, nose, and throat and can also cause existing heart and lung problems in people to worsen or lead to lung cancer if the exposure time of smog is long. It also leads to premature death.”\n\n<i>(Smog Season. Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nTips to Keep Your Lungs Healthy During Smog Season\n\nWhile exposure to winter smog can be challenging to avoid, there are effective measures to protect your lungs and mitigate the risks of poor air quality. The American Lung Association (ALA) recommends the following tips for maintaining lung health:\n\nStay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps maintain a healthy mucus lining in your respiratory system.\n\nIncrease fibre intake: Studies suggest that people with higher fibre consumption tend to have better lung function.\n\nLimit outdoor exercise: Avoid exercising outdoors during smoggy conditions. Opt for indoor alternatives, such as climbing stairs or using indoor fitness equipment.\n\nReduce energy use: Contribute to cleaner air by conserving energy. The ALA notes that generating electricity and other energy sources contributes to air pollution.\n\nnotes that generating electricity and other energy sources contributes to air pollution. Avoid burning wood and trash: Burning these materials significantly increases particle pollution in many regions.\n\nImprove indoor air quality: Adopt air-purifying plants or invest in air purifiers to ensure cleaner indoor air.\n\nMinimize gasoline-powered tools: Cutting down on the use of gasoline-powered equipment can also help reduce air pollution.",

		"title": "Apple Working on Smarter Siri with ChatGPT-like Capabilities, Likely to Launch in 2026",
		"text": "Apple is working on a more advanced form of Siri that will be powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). The updated Siri will have better conversational capabilities, something rivals like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are already offering to the users.\n\nTo recall, Apple announced generative AI-based features for iPhones, iPads and Macs, earlier this. While some features have already been rolled out to Apple device users, other including ChatGPT support are expected to be rolled out in the coming months. In addition to generative AI-based features, the company has also rolled out updates to Siri, including personal context understanding, on-screen awareness, in-app actions and glowing edge light. Despite these updates, Siri is far less conversational compared to other gen AI-based assistants, including Gemini.\n\nNow, a Bloomberg report says that Apple is planning to bridge this gap by giving advanced LLM capabilities to Siri. The revamped Siri will be able to interact with users in a way that is closer to Gemini and ChatGPT. It will also offer a more granular control over actions in third-party apps to the users.\n\nThe report also says that the new features will not be announced right away. Instead, the company plans to take a gradual approach towards introducing the new features in Siri. The company is planning to take the same approach that it took in case of Apple Intelligence, which was announced at WWDC 2024 and started rolling out with iOS 18.1 update. Apple is reportedly planning to announce the updated Siri, dubbed as LLM Siri, with iOS 19, which will arrive sometime in 2025, with the roll out beginning as early as the Spring of 2026.",

		"text": "India will offer up to $5 billion in incentives to companies to make components locally for gadgets from mobiles to laptops, two government officials said, in a bid to bolster the burgeoning industry and wean off supplies from China.\n\nIndia's electronic production has more than doubled in the last six years to $115 billion in 2024, led by growth in mobile manufacturing by global firms such as Apple and Samsung . It is now the world's fourth-largest smart phone supplier.\n\nBut the sector faces criticism for its heavy reliance on imported components from countries such as China.\n\n\"The new scheme will incentivise production of key components like printed circuit boards that will improve domestic value addition and deepen local supply chains for a range of electronics,\" one of the two officials said.\n\nThe incentives are likely to be offered under a new scheme expected to be launched in two to three months, said the officials, who asked not to be identified as details of the scheme are not yet public.\n\nThe scheme is likely to offer incentives totaling between $4-$5 billion to global or local firms which qualify.\n\nThe plan, designed by the India's electronics ministry, has identified components eligible for incentives and is in its final stages.\n\nThe finance ministry will approve the scheme's final allocation soon, the first official added, with the sources expecting it to be launched in the next 2-3 months.\n\nIndia's electronics ministry and finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia is aiming to expand its electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by the fiscal year 2030, including production of components worth $150 billion, according to the government's top policy think tank Niti Aayog.\n\nIndia imported electronics, telecoms gear, and electrical products worth $89.8 billion in the fiscal year 2024, with more than half sourced from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis by private think tank GTRI.",

		"title": "\"Too Slow\": Yashasvi Jaiswal Brutally Mocks Mitchell Starc In Perth. Australia Pacer Does This - Watch",
		"text": "After India bowlers restricted Australia to just 104 in the first innings of the first Test in Perth, it was time for openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul to take the team ahead. The left-right combination played sensible cricket, with some able assistance from Australia's sub-par fielding, and took India to a 150-plus total. The Indian duo looked super confident, with Yashasvi Jaiswal taking a special liking for Mitchell Starc. On one of the occasions, Jaiswal even mocked Starc, saying: \"It's coming too slow.\"\n\nStarc could not help but smile after hearing this.\n\nIndian openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul formed an exceptional partnership of 84 runs as the visitors lead by 130 runs at the end of the second session of the opening Test match at the Optus Stadium on Saturday.\n\nAt the end of the second session of the Perth Test, India are 84/0 with Yashasvi Jaiswal (42*) and KL Rahul (34*) unbeaten on the crease. The visitors lead by 130 runs in the match.\n\nThe second session kicked off with Indian openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul opening the innings with the visitors leading by 46 runs.\n\nBoth the batters started off the innings slowly but picked up the pace later on and started attacking the opponent bowlers.\n\nJaiswal and Rahul completed their 50-run partnership in the 15th over of the innings as the latter took a triple on the bowling of right-arm seamer Pat Cummins.\n\nIn the next over (16th), the Jasprit Bumrah-led side completed the lead of 100 runs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecapping the first session of the Perth Test on Day 2, Australia started the second day at 67/7, with Mitchell Starc (6*) and Alex Carey (19*) unbeaten.\n\nSkipper Jasprit Bumrah struck for India early, removing in-form wicketkeeper Carey for 21 in 31 balls, with three fours. He was caught behind by keeper Rishabh Pant. It also brought up Bumrah's 11th five-wicket haul in Tests. Australia was 70/8.\n\nIn the 33rd over, Harshit Rana got the wicket of Nathan Lyon for just five runs. Lyon could not pick up the short ball and tried to steer it past third man, but it hit his glove and went to KL Rahul in the slips. Australia was 79/9.\n\nFollowing this, Starc and Hazlewood frustrated Indian bowlers by putting up the first decent partnership of their innings. While Hazlewood blocked pretty much everything, Starc would let out a hit now and then. They took Australia to the 100-run mark in 45.4 overs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wait for a wicket finally came to an end after 110 balls, with Starc skying one in the air and the ball was caught by Pant easily. Starc's patient and defiant 26 in 112 balls, with two fours, came to an end.",

		"text": "Delhi AQI: 8 Herbs You Should Say Yes To Boost Your Respiratory Health | Image: Pexels\n\nNative to Asia and Europe, horehound has been traditionally used to treat various health issues, especially respiratory problems.\n\nIt contains a powerful expectorant which makes people with severe coughs expel mucus that clogs the airways.\n\nAs cold winter approaches viral fevers are unavoidable. Hence, keep this recipe handy as you might need it at any time.\n\n<i>(Horehound. image: Pexels)</i>\n\nIngredients To Prepare Horehound Cough Drops\n\n1 ¼ cup boiling water\n\n2 cups of organic cane sugar\n\n50 grams of dried horehound\n\n1/3 tsp. cream of tartar\n\n<i>(Horehound.

As it sets, score it with a sharp knife. Cut along the lines when it is cooled and brittle.\n\nStore pieces in an airtight container.\n\nIf your mixture does not harden – store the syrup in an airtight container and store in a cool, dry location. Use within 4 months – if not needed, then discard.",

		"text": "“For instance, when the government announces an entrepreneurial or start-up scheme at a state level and does not notify its eligibility rules and application process to its various districts, a transgender person from a rural area in Nagpur would not have the capacity to follow up on the opportunity like a person who has the support of CBOs/NGOs concentrated in cities,” Disha explains.\n\n“In urban localities, there is greater collaboration between different civil society actors – human rights groups, lawyer networks, and media professionals. Hence, the work of holding the government accountable is shared. In less affluent regions, it is a lonely battle. The transgender applicant has to carry the burden of informing the local government offices of such a scheme, and then await its implementation at a district level. If it does not come through, they must again carry the burden of summoning the appropriate government to a court of law or give up opportunities in silence.”\n\nThere is a constitutional urgency to these demands. However, the entire framework of transgender welfare boards carries one caveat with no easy answers. The welfare boards – which presently act in an advisory capacity – have transgender persons as members who are appointed by the government, rather than elected through any democratic means or communitarian consensus. Thus, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether one privileges the government's will which appoints them, or the community with which they share their identity.\n\nMoreover, the consensus across the political aisle on restricting transgender and gender non-conforming persons’ direct access to the power of law-making and limiting it to welfare boards is symptomatic of India’s pervasive transphobia and the reluctance of various governments and political parties to invest in changing prevailing social attitudes among its population.\n\n(Vaivab Das is a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and a Fulbright Fellow at the University of California Berkeley. They research at intersections of gender, sexuality and law.)\n\n(This story was produced as part of the InQlusive Newsrooms Media Fellowship 2023.

		"title": "Violence of Any Form is Unacceptable. India Must Criminalise Marital Rape",
		"text": "Judicial outcomes must transcend prior judgments and public sentiment, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of each case backed by expert data to ensure equitable law application. Educated women with high aspirations are less likely to misuse Section 498A; instead, they tend to pursue divorce when faced with unsatisfactory marriages. Moreover, the cultural understanding of marriage often lacks clarity regarding consent.\n\nSome women may take advantage of legal protections, but men also perpetrate similar abuses. No law is immune to manipulation through influence and financial power, leading to compromised investigations and prolonged court processes that hinder justice. This highlights the urgent need for reform and robust enforcement, rather than stalling the introduction of new laws or repealing existing ones because of weak implementation.\n\nGlobally, various strategies have been adopted to address the misuse of marital rape laws effectively, with countries like the US and the UK establishing clear legal definitions of marital rape to ensure consistent enforcement. In the UK, specialised police units address sexual violence, including marital rape cases. Many countries prioritise judicial training for judges and law enforcement to sensitively handle these issues, distinguishing between valid claims and false accusations.",

		"text": "As parents, it is our responsibility to demand more from our elected leaders, not just for ourselves, but for the next generation. We cannot remain passive spectators as the health of our children and the future of our society are jeopardised. Here’s how we can start:\n\n1. Demand Accountability in Election Manifestos: In the run-up to elections, we must demand that every political party include detailed, actionable plans to tackle pollution. This isn’t just about votes; it’s about the future health of our children. We need actionable promises, not vague statements. Every party must present a clear blueprint for tackling this crisis.\n\n2. Revise School Holidays: We must speak to our schools about changing the academic calendar. If pollution continues to worsen every winter, we need to rethink how we approach school breaks. Shortening summer vacations and extending winter holidays could allow our children to be less exposed during the peak pollution months.\n\n3. Demand Action: Never underestimate the power of persistent communication. Write to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the Ministry of Environment, and to our Chief Ministers. Petition them for real solutions. They need to feel the pressure from us—concerned citizens who demand action, not just empty promises.\n\n4. Vote with Accountability in Mind: Politicians understand one language—votes. We must make our voices heard, not just at the ballot box, but by holding them accountable for their inaction. Demand clear answers and measurable results. Pollution must become a priority, and it must be reflected in every election.\n\n5. Stand Up for Health: Most of us will find ourselves in and out of doctors' chambers, treating the long-term effects of pollution. But why should we silently accept this? As law-abiding, tax-paying citizens, we should be in the streets demanding accountability. Why isn’t there more pressure on the government to take urgent action?\n\n6. Demand Transparency and Urgent Action: Why isn't there an emergency task force meeting led by the PMO along with all relevant stakeholders to address pollution daily? Why isn’t there an action plan being shared with citizens, detailing how they plan to reduce pollution levels? It’s time for the government to stop treating this as an afterthought and make the citizens a part of the solution.\n\nIf we don't act now, we risk condemning future generations to a life of compromised health and a damaged environment. This silent crisis is slowly but surely silencing lives. It’s up to us, as parents and citizens, to break the cycle of inaction and demand the change that our children desperately need. The question is: will we wait for another crisis to force us to act, or will we finally rise and take responsibility for the future our children deserve? All they are asking for is the right to breathe—an inalienable right we must not fail to protect.\n\n(Vedika Sud is the parent of a 9-year-old and former reporter with CNN International.

There has to be a political will, which is clearly lacking,\" Chennai-based environment writer and researcher Nithyanand Jayaram told The Quint.\n\n\"If despite being a performance-linked initiative, the programme has large amount of unutilised funds and fails to yield significant results, it means that the implementation system is broken. The implementation in this case largely relies on State Pollution Control Boards, which we've known for very long, are neither adequately staffed nor answerable to anybody,\" he added.\n\nWhile the programme was initially aimed to curb the concentration of PM 2.5 and PM 10 to improve air quality in target cities, only PM 10 concentration is being considered for performance assessment. This, the environment ministry, in one of its annual reports, had attributed to a lack of monitoring stations for PM 2.5.\n\n\"We can send rocket to space but not set up enough monitoring stations for PM 2.5 in 131 Indian cities? Like I said, there is a clear lack of intent to solve the problem of pollution,\" Jayaram added.\n\nPM 2.5 is a tinier sub set of PM10 and poses a greater health risk as it penetrates deeper into the lungs, entering the bloodstream and affecting nearly all human organs.",

		"title": "Reminder: Treat Exit Polls Like Popcorn",
		"text": "Pollsters talk to the same set of voters. So, why do they give different calls?\n\nThere are multiple reasons for disparities. While pollsters go about scientific sampling, voters may or may not respond in the same scientific manner. For example, some voting groups may be less fearful of participating in such surveys, others may not.\n\nFurthermore, some (if not many) voters may actually lie (for whatever reason) to the interviewers. The pollster then needs to make a correction for this and very often uses historical information to do the same.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, predicting who will win is not easy for the agencies. However, their difference of opinion can still provide key takeaways.\n\nIf the NDA wins Maharashtra and loses Jharkhand, as some pollsters suggest, it means that the Ladki Bahin/Maiya Samman scheme has worked in both states. If the NDA wins both states, it means that Ladki Bahin Yojana worked in Maharashtra, but a similar scheme did not work in Jharkhand, which is counterintuitive.\n\nIf the Mahayuti wins Maharashtra, it would suggest that issues like agrarian distress, inflation, unemployment, rural distress, corruption, and the Maratha agitation have all been trumped by the Ladki Bahin Yojana and the micro-management of the BJP.\n\nIf the MVA wins, like two agencies predicting, then it means exactly the opposite, i.e., that all bread-and-butter issues did matter, and soft bribing of voters does not work.\n\nIf the JMM-led alliance wins Jharkhand, then tribal asmita (identity/pride) played a key role which trumped the BJP’s batenge toh katenge narrative. It would establish Hemant Soren as the undisputed leader of tribals.\n\nIf the NDA wins Jharkhand, then the BJP’s allegedly divisive politics worked, and the non-tribals consolidated in large numbers behind the BJP.\n\nIf the NDA wins both Maharashtra and Jharkhand, then the BJP would be able to prove that the 2024 general elections were an aberration, and PM Modi is back with a bang (especially after Haryana). It would then push forward contentious bills like the UCC, Waqf, One Nation One Election, etc.\n\nIf the NDA loses Maharashtra and Jharkhand, then it would highlight that the Modi magic is indeed fading, and unemployment and inflation continue to be big issues as suggested by the results of the general elections.\n\nBut treat exit polls like popcorn.\n\nExit polls remain in the minds of viewers and clients for a longer time than opinion poll surveys. There is, therefore, much more pressure to deliver accurate results. That is where the background of the pollsters matters a lot.\n\nExit polls quench our curiosity and excitement between the last day of the election and counting day. Even if they are wrong, they provide a catchy start that keeps us hooked till the end of counting day, just like the first scene of a film. It is better, therefore, to think of exit polls as nothing more than popcorn.\n\n(Amitabh Tiwari is an independent political commentator and can be reached at @politicalbaaba on X [formerly Twitter].

		"text": "1. Tapping Into Sena MLAs' Discontent With Congress-NCP\n\nFirst, tapping into the severe discontent in the Shiv Sena with the Congress-NCP in 2019. The most unusual alliance was formed in 2019 when Uddhav Thackeray broke ties with the BJP and joined hands with the Congress-NCP. The rising discomfort of Sena office bearers and MLAs and the alleged accessibility of Uddhav Thackeray was Shinde's gain that led to the rebellion.\n\n2. Becoming the People's CM\n\nThe doors of Varsha, the official bungalow of the Maharashtra CM, were always open for the common man - this is a fact that many covering him and his politics will tell you. But what really put him on the pedestal was people-friendly schemes — the Laadki Bahin Yojana of direct Rs1,500 cash transfer into women's accounts, subsidised bus travel for women in MSRTC commute, schemes for free education for girl children till graduation, subsidised medical treatments at the chain of 'Aapla Davakhana' clinics, scores of development projects in Mumbai and across the state — all these initiatives, even though may be credited to leaders or ministers of allies, happened under him at the helm.\n\n3. A Hard Bargainer\n\nDespite clear attempts by the BJP, he proved his bargaining power not only when he became the CM with BJP's support in 2022, but also during seat sharing talks in both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. Despite the NCP coming on board, he made sure that the Shiv Sena not only gets to contest the maximum number of seats, but also proved to have a better strike rate, including in the seats where he was in a direct fight with Uddhav thackeray's Shiv Sena.\n\n4. Successfully Claimed Bal Thackeray's Hindutva Legacy\n\nHe successfully drove the narrative that Uddhav Thackeray compromised the Hindutva of late Bal Thackeray by joining hands with the Congress, a sentiment that was already being spoken of uncomfortably even by those who supported Thackeray in the split. With the entire BJP-Sena machinery at his disposal, he changed tides in his favour for the past two years.",

		"text": "In an unquestionably massive lead of over 220 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party's Mahayuti alliance has won the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi of the Congress-Sena UBT and NCPSP has managed to get seats double digits collectively.\n\nHow did this happen? 6 reasons:\n\nWomen: Popularity of schemes like Ladki Bahin that gives Rs 1,500 per month, Annapurna yojana that gives 3 gas cylinders free per month, and concession on bus MSRTC bus travels, the thickest network of transport in the state, free education for girl students till graduation, gave the Mahayuti the biggest edge. At the same time, the Mahayuti was successfully able to drive the narrative that all these welfare schemes will stop if the Opposition comes to power.\n\nMarathas: Manoj Jarange's movement for Maratha reservation failed to consolidate votes in the Opposition's favour like it did in Lok Sabha. In fact, compared to the Lok Sabha elections, the Mahayuti has performed way better in Marathwada\n\nFarmers: Farmers of both Vidarbha and Marathwada voted heavily against the ruling Mahayuti in Lok Sabha. Inflation, drought, no MSP for soyabean and cotton, onion export ban, were some of the key reasons behind NDA's loss in Lok Saha. The BJP and Mahayuti got to course correction since Lok Sabha. The ban on onion export was lifted, MSP for cotton and soyabean was increased even if marginally so, and several schemes were announced like Baliraja Vij Savlat Yojana for free electricity for irrigation pumps.",

Their individual struggles bind the three women together especially in the ways their identities contribute to how or how much they can fight their circumstances.\n\nParvathy’s identity as a woman can’t be separated from her fight – she has been so distanced from the possibility of owning her own home that, once widowed, she can’t even find the papers for the shanty.",

The needle of his suspicion moves to Vikrant almost instantly – he is shifty and terrified for his life. For a man with small dreams, everything happening around him only overwhelms him, forcing him to make quick, often erroneous, judgements. Director Sidharth Sengupta tries to keep track of all the twists and turns he’s already established and for the most part, it works but the flaws become evident too soon. Purva, who was the axis of the entire show, spends a lot of her time trying to escape and survive but with the show’s multiple, moving parts, we don’t get to truly engage with this fight.\n\nNor can we properly sit with Vikrant’s quickly unraveling sense of self and Shikha’s internal struggle. Shikha, now married, tries to balance the expectations that come with her new life and the reality she has been trying to deny for a while.",

Most of us aren’t – social media has technically replaced other forms of ‘passing time’ that we perhaps used as a mode to ‘escape’ things.\n\nThe unsettling feeling at the heart of Ctrl is translated to the viewer in the understanding that you are Nella and not only that, you are also the people on her screen. The trolls, the hate comments, the parasocial relationship people have formed with Nella and Joe, the numbers rising that lead to virality, it’s all of us. You are part of the ecosystem Nella operates in and the only thing separating you from her is the hyperbole. And the comfort that you are watching a piece of fiction.",

This is approximately 67 times the rate in India.\n\nEvery 10 minutes, at least one more person is added to the waitlist of people who need an organ donation. Over 3 lakh people are already on the waitlist. At least 20 people die each day while on that waitlist.\n\nBut what happens when it is the woman who needs the kidney?\n\nThey are not really prioritised by their families, say experts. Out of the total 36,640 patients who underwent (any) organ transplants between 1995 and 2021, 29,695 were men, NOTTO data showed.\n\nSo, if there are no living organ donors – or as in case of India, no mothers, wives or daughters to make the 'sacrifice' – the chances of dying while waiting for an organ are almost inevitable.",

		"text": "This operation did not target a specific country, but sent these queries to fact-checkers everywhere.\n\nThe European Fact-Checking Standards Network’s communications manager Samantha Lee told us that their partner organisations started getting these emails at the end of 2023, and still received them after the campaign was exposed.\n\n\n\nGuillaume Kuster, the co-founder of CheckFirst, a Finnish software and methodologies company sent us their collaborative research on the same operation, which they named “Operation Overload.”\n\nThe operation dated back to “at least to August 2023,” and mirrored a similar operation on X (formerly Twitter), which was a Russian-led disinformation campaign called “Matryoshka”. Their research identified 100 X accounts that had shared or amplified this disinformation since October 2023.\n\n“The analysed accounts exhibit clear markers of coordinated inauthentic behaviour,” it stated, mentioning that they showed specific behavioural patterns and calling them “a tactic likely designed to minimise detection by the platform.”\n\n\n\nBoth organisations found that platforms had not succeeded in restricting the spread, or even identifying this pattern.\n\n“A lot of content is spread via the same Telegram channels,” CORRECTIV’s Max Bernhard told us, which went in line with these reporters’ findings. “The platform doesn’t appear to conduct any content moderation, especially when it comes to pro-Russian content.”\n\nOn X, however, CORRECTIV saw “limited action” to remove accounts that were a part of this campaign. Bernahard opined that X “clearly isn’t doing enough since the campaign, and similar campaigns, have only expanded in scope.”\n\nCheck First’s report, which was created in collaboration with 20+ fact-checking organisations, mentioned that Germany’s CORRECTIV had engaged with one of them.\n\nThey received a response to their feedback on the claims made, which initially expressed “respect and trust” in CORRECTIV’s work, but made the goal of the campaign clear when they asked — “Is it possible for your work to be seen by as many people as possible?”\n\nMyth Detector Georgia had initially “engaged and responded to” the senders by telling them that they would work on the disseminated posts to verify whether it was true. “I don’t recall them replying after our response,” a member of their team wrote.\n\nGoal Was to ‘Overwhelm Fact-Checkers, Amplify Disinformation’\n\nBernhard, Lee, and Myth Detector Georgia shared the opinion that the goal might be to ‘waste time’ or ‘to tie up the resources’ of fact-checking organisations.\n\n“Another reason may be that, if media report on the campaign’s content, they may see that as a sign of the campaign’s success that they can show their possible clients,” adding that he believed that the campaign was “not so successful.” - Bernhard\n\n“Because of fact-checkers’ crucial work against disinformation, they are often targeted by rogue actors, such as those you are referring to, who do not like to be called on their lies.” - Lee\n\nKuster, however, said that CheckFirst was not “directly impacted” as they do not publish fact-checks. “However, we’ve listed (until June 4th) over 200 debunks or fact-checks published by media outlets.”\n\nWe interpret the purpose of this operation as two-fold: target newsrooms and fact-checkers with fabricated pro-russian fake content and try to have them fact-check content which has not been widely spread, exposing it to larger audiences through the publication of fact-checks or debunks,” Kuster told The Quint , referring to the Streisand effect — which involves bringing more attention to a piece of information while attempting to conceal, censor, or remove it.\n\nKuster’s statement went along with our findings. For many of these purported “claims,” we struggled to find more posts sharing disinformation on social media platforms. Debunking that piece of disinformation would inevitably grab more attention than not publishing a fact-check about the false claim would.\n\nHow does it impact the average social media user? It might, or it might not. Berhnard believes that it is difficult to assess the impact of such campaigns. “The campaign may also give the impression to users on these platforms that there is higher support for pro-Russian narratives than there actually is.”\n\nHe stressed on the need for people to be aware, and know that “malicious actors try to spread false content by for example impersonating established media such as the BBC.\n\nX and Telegram are not a source for reliable information - readers should seek out trusted media outlets and get their information directly at the source.”\n\nBernhard recommended conducting “a simple Google search” whenever one comes across these claims, to look for coverage by other media outlets or fact-checks by newsrooms.\n\nCredits\n\nReporters\n\nAishwarya Varma\n\nAbhishek Anand\n\nSenior Editor\n\nAbhilash Mallick\n\nCreative Director\n\nNaman Shah\n\nCover Graphic\n\nKamran Akhter\n\nProduction Assistant\n\nAnoushka Jain\n\nAdditional Graphics\n\nMidjourney, directed by Naman Shah",

Since 2015, Chennai has seen floods, cyclones and heavy rainfall events.\n\nAnd yet, by 2030, just 8 years from now, over 70% of Chennai will not have water.\n\nEvery year since 2015, Chennai has been living the collective trauma of the crisis. Every year, it is the same colonies that get affected. The same people who have to run for shelter.\n\nThe city gets an average of about 1,400 mm (55 inches) of rainfall a year. Known as a water-rich capital, Chennai hit the headlines in 2019 for being one of the first major cities in the world to run out of water — trucking in 10 million litres a day to hydrate its population. And yet in January 2021, it had the wettest January in decades.\n\nThe age-old adage, ‘Water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink’ fits perfectly well to describe Chennai today.\n\nI know exactly which streets will get flooded when it rains because it is the same story every monsoon. But the question that Chennaities like me are asking is why do we oscillate between a flood and drought-like situation year on year?\n\n\n\nThe truth is that while weather patterns have been erratic due to climate change, Chennai has added to its own woes as half the city has no stormwater drains and the rest of it is relying on what was built over 6 decades ago.",

		"title": "The Silent Killer of Kerala's Marine Life",
		"text": "A few kilometres ahead of the factory lies the coastal village of Poonthura, densely populated and bustling with fishing activities. The difference between Veli (where the effluent outlet is located) and Poonthura Beach was quite distinct. Peter, who sat on the shore wearing a bright pink shirt and knitting a fishing net, said, “I was 12 when I went out fishing for the first time. Back then, we would go hardly a kilometre inside the ocean because the fish varieties were in abundance. Now, the cost of kerosene and other items have gone up, but our incomes are dwindling because all the fish seem to be disappearing,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about what he believes could be the reason, he said, “We know nothing beyond the limits of our village because we believe everything that the church says, and we’ve been told that this is just God's punishment.”\n\nWhile a citizen-led movement has been going on for decades here, it was surprising to see several fisherfolk, like Peter, who are unaware of the effects of the effluents being released by the factory. (Photo: Smitha TK) While a citizen-led movement has been going on for decades here, it was surprising to see several fisherfolk, like Peter, who are unaware of the effects of the effluents being released by the factory. (Photo: Smitha TK)\n\nRosemary, too, shared that while she is aware of the depleting count of marine life, she entrusts the church to make decisions for their lives and livelihoods.\n\nMichael pointed out that the Vettucaud church has served as a poignant emblem of persistent societal protests spanning numerous decades. It has become a locus of inquiry where individuals seek resolutions to inquiries encompassing domains such as spirituality, cultural heritage, environmental concerns, and the frontiers of scientific knowledge, he shared.\n\nFor the people of Poonthura, their lives revolve around the church and the beach. Be it religious sermons, a game of rummy, a cricket match or a protest, people gather at this place near the church. (Photo: Smitha TK) For the people of Poonthura, their lives revolve around the church and the beach. Be it religious sermons, a game of rummy, a cricket match or a protest, people gather at this place near the church. (Photo: Smitha TK)\n\nBut it is “the uninformed way in which the church interferes in matters of science that has derailed their movement,” he added.\n\nVincent Raj, who has been taking people on 'toxic walks' along the coastline to showcase the extent of damage, said the church has been the primary enabler for these projects, plaguing the coast.\n\nThe Poonthura church has been a focal point of discussions, protests, and negotiations amid the fisherfolk, church, government, and company. (Photo: Smitha TK) The Poonthura church has been a focal point of discussions, protests, and negotiations amid the fisherfolk, church, government, and company. (Photo: Smitha TK)\n\n“When the church welcomed the Vizhinjam port, we explained that this will affect marine life, the coastline, and livelihoods, thus changing the course of nature. The church can serve the spiritual needs of the people, but why is it intervening in every day issues pertaining to the people? This is a crime being done in the name of God.”\n\nSeveral leaders in these coastal villages told The Quint that every time their agitation catches steam, the church strikes up a deal with the company, and the issue fizzles away.\n\n“At the end of every negotiation, we've seen the priest agree that the factory is innocent, which is bizarre. Then we will find out whether the company is funding the annual church festival or contributing to its painting. We are gatekeepers of the ocean, and here we are trading their lives and ours for the benefit of the rich. This community is living in its own bubble, like a frog in a well. Capitalising on the people’s trust, the church has been advocating the initiatives by TTP,” said Cruz.\n\nThe Quint spoke to several people of the fishing community who have participated in protests over four decades who echoed this sentiment. A 48-year-old man from Poonthura village, who didn’t wish to be named fearing backlash, said that he had spearheaded several protests but is now “tired of their efforts being quashed by the church.” He added, “I have given up the fight. Just two years ago, I threw away so many cartons of case sheets and meeting reports.”\n\nWhen The Quint spoke to a few priests, they vehemently refuted the allegations. “We work for the welfare of the people so we take decisions in their best interest,” said a senior priest, who refused to comment further or give his name.\n\n“The problem is we don’t have environmental lawyers or activists here. These protests are spearheaded by a few locals, and so when they lose interest, the movement loses momentum. The government is also playing with the minds of people by telling the company to throw temporary solutions at the fickle-minded, ignorant public,” said Jament.\n\nAjith, a fisherman who has been documenting the experiences of fellow fishermen regarding the decline in marine life over the years and the repercussions of effluent dumping, said, “The government and company have managed to create the illusion that this is just a micro issue. Unlike fisherfolk in Tamil Nadu, there is no collective support here in Kerala. Many fishermen believe only we got the benefit of jobs so we are alone in this fight. But our only solution is to just continue to collectively protest,” he said.\n\nClimate rights activist AJ Vijayan believes that what makes this a complicated fight is that this fragile coastline has been stressed by several development projects such as TTPL and Vizhinjam port project.\n\n“The CPI(M) and the Congress are arguing about who was responsible for these development projects. If that's the attitude and they are focussed on ‘development at any cost,’ how do you expect them to extradite action? Several ministers have paid bribes to common folk living a little away from the problem to sway the people. Despite being plagued by several natural and man-made disasters in the recent past, the state hasn’t come up with mitigation measures to combat climate change,” he said.\n\nInterestingly, just a few months ago, the company sanctioned a welfare package for the villages which an activist described as, “Well, now it is all about something is better than nothing. We might as well get amenities while we face degradation.”\n\nGeorgee Ninan of TTPL said, “We have approved welfare packages to the tune of Rs 1.2 crore. We have introduced a small finance scheme through which fisherfolk can borrow money to grow their business. We are also providing assistance for those who can’t afford medical treatment and education.” There was no mention of jobs.",

However, the Central Government through its various Schemes supplements their efforts for promoting / developing sports in the country, which includes extending sports facilities in various states / UTs.\n\n\"We need people in the district and state federations to start working,\" said Manisha Malhotra, Head of Sports Excellence and Scouting at JSW sports, who was part of the Olympic campaigns of both of India's gold medalists – Abhinav Bindra and Neeraj Chopra. \"Everywhere else in the world, sports is a huge part of schooling. In India, school sports are still nascent. That's where we need to get going.\"\n\nExcept hockey, India hasn't won a single Olympic medal in any other team sport. \"That's because team sports require centralised coordination between states that can only be done by a central government body.

At the time of writing the story, the party had won or was leading on 71 percent of the seats it contested.\n\nHow did this turnaround come about, that too in just about five months?\n\nCentral to the turnaround in Ajit Pawar's fortunes was the political consultancy handling his campaign - DesignBoxed, which has till now worked mostly with senior Congress leaders like DK Shivakumar, Ashok Gehlot, TS Singh Deo and a few Congress state units.\n\nThe company's co-founder Naresh Arora had stationed himself in Maharashtra for the past four months and managed every aspect of Ajit Pawar's campaign. There are broadly six aspects to their intervention.",

		"text": "Actor Vikrant Massey has stirred a fresh debate around India’s independence and Hindu identity through his statements in promotion of his new film, The Sabarmati Report, based on the 2002 Godhra incident. In interviews, Massey has raised questions that go beyond cinema.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Massey questioned whether India’s 1947 independence was truly freedom, calling it a “so-called” independence. He suggested that Hindus only recently found a space to assert their identity within the country. Comparing India’s history of colonization, he claimed that Hindu identity only emerged openly in the last decade, sparking outrage among some who argue that India's independence movement and Constitution have always ensured every citizen’s identity.\n\nThis viewpoint has brought Massey comparisons to BJP MP Kangana Ranaut, who previously made similar claims, suggesting that “real” independence came only in 2014. Such remarks invite scrutiny as they attempt to rewrite national history in favor of contemporary narratives. However, Massey’s statements also highlight a recurring theme in Indian cinema: using historical and religious narratives to appeal to specific audiences.",

If people could be made to work 14 hours a day, then just 24 employees would do.\n\nThe wage bill would drop by 43 percent, and it would do wonders for profit margins.\n\nOf course, if a company started extending work hours, while others stuck to an 8-hour workday, all its employees would quit. It could still hold on to them, by offering slightly higher salaries.\n\nFor instance, in our previous example, instead of paying Rs 50,000 for eight hours, the firm could offer Rs 65,000 for 14 hours. This would attract many workers, who would be willing to work longer for higher pay. And, despite paying higher salaries, the company would end up saving 26 percent on its labour cost.",

		"text": "With Donald Trump having secured a comfortable victory in the US presidential election, what is the way forward for ties between Washington and New Delhi?\n\nWhile the Indian government had consistently maintained its willingness to deal with either of the candidates, the victory of Trump or Kamala Harris was bound to present India with different sets of benefits and challenges.\n\nOne of the supposed upsides of a Trump win for the Narendra Modi government is familiarity, having dealt with his administration closely in the past. The bonhomie between the two leaders has also been publicly evident: for instance, the events they appeared in together, namely the 2019 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston and 'Namaste Trump' in Ahmedabad the following year.",

		"text": "There are two things at play here. Firstly, I believe that my relationship with the fans is not only on the pitch, but also off the pitch, and that has happened because of the longevity of my career. It is because of the number of years I have played. So for anyone to reach anywhere close – and I promise you they will – it will take time.\n\nNow coming to the second point. I completely agree that they should play as strikes. I've encouraged all of our young strikers to at least go and challenge, and show that you are good enough. When you do get a game and you prove that you are good enough, the coach doesn't care about your nationality. The club doesn't care. They want to win games. They do not care whether it's a Manvir Singh or a Jorge Pereyra Diaz scoring the goals. They don't care whether it's a Roy Krishna or a Rahim Ali. They will not care. You get them goals, you get them what they want and they will play you. No club or coach cares about which nationality the striker is from. They just want to win games. For example, last to last year. Roy Krishna and Sunil Chhetri both sat on the bench, but a certain Sivasakthi Narayanan played all the games for Bengaluru FC. Now, who would have thought that before the season started? Roy sat out some games, then I sat out some games, but Siva played all the games. I always tell the young strikers that go and challenge. At least tell the coaches that you want to play as number nine. Of course, if it doesn't happen in due time, you can always think about going left or right, but at least go and challenge. As difficult as the number nine position is, it is the most important and most fulfilling position. You change the fate of a team. We all train really hard to defend, but scoring is a very, very important aspect. England is one of the favourites in Euros, but their second-highest score is Bukayo Saka with only a few goals. The highest goal-scorer is Harry Kane with some 60-odd goals. So they need Harry Kane, no matter how good these guys like Saka and Phil Foden are.",

However, the expatriates from South Asia, who have kept their love and commitment for cricket alive even when playing or watching their favourite sport is a tough task in the USA, are thronging to the cities hosting World Cup matches with ever-increasing enthusiasm.",

I also can’t help but wonder if there were other ways for the organisers to take accountability.\n\nComing back to the roast, in another “joke” you said that Kusha fixed her eyebrows and became fit because people would make fun of her appearance. Another insecurity you tapped into that was completely unnecessary. Then you went on to say, “Wish people had made fun of her marriage too.”",

		"text": "For NRIs with pensions in the UK, moving back to India for retirement raises important financial questions. Should you leave your pension in the UK, exposing yourself to taxes, currency risks, and limited withdrawal options? Or should you explore solutions that allow you to transfer your pension to India, where it can work more efficiently for you?\n\n\n\nThis is where HDFC Life QROPs (Qualifying Recognized Overseas Pension Scheme) comes in—offering NRIs a solution to manage these challenges and help secure a financially sound retirement back home.\n\n\n\nLet’s break this down using a case study\n\n\n\nTake the case of Rajesh Verma, a 40-year-old software engineer who’s spent the last 15 years working in London. Over that time, Rajesh has built up a neat little nest egg of £500,000, in a UK pension fund. With plans to retire in India, Rajesh faces several pressing issues:\n\n1. Currency Risk: His pension is in British pounds, but his expenses in India will be in rupees. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate between GBP and INR could drastically reduce his pension’s value in rupees, leaving him with less than expected.\n\n2. Tax Penalties: UK pensions are subject to a lifetime allowance cap of £1,073,100. Rajesh’s pension is currently below that, but over time it could exceed the limit, leading to tax penalties as high as 55% on the excess amount.\n\n3. Limited Flexibility: UK pensions often require retirees to purchase an annuity, locking them into a fixed income. Rajesh prefers more control over how he accesses his funds.\n\n\n\nAfter consulting with experts, Rajesh opted to transfer his pension to HDFC Life QROPs, which offered key benefits:\n\n- Currency stability by receiving his pension in Indian Rupees, eliminating currency fluctuations.\n\n- Avoiding UK taxes by bypassing the lifetime allowance cap.\n\n- Flexibility to choose between lump sums or staggered withdrawals, allowing him to manage his pension based on his needs.\n\n\n\nRajesh’s decision to use HDFC Life QROPs means his pension now supports his retirement goals without the tax burdens or currency risks he would have faced in the UK.",

		"text": "As the cost of living continues to rise, the importance of safeguarding and growing wealth becomes ever more pressing. Young investors, particularly those new to the financial markets, often find themselves drawn to the promise of compound interest—a concept that has earned its reputation as a cornerstone of effective wealth management. However, to truly harness the power of compound interest, it is crucial to also navigate the often-underestimated force of inflation. This article explores how compound interest works, its potential limitations due to inflation, and why advanced investment strategies such as ELSS and ULIPs are essential tools in a long-term financial plan.\n\n\n\nCompound Interest: A Reliable Tool for Growth\n\nCompound interest is a well-known financial mechanism celebrated for its ability to accelerate the growth of investments over time. Unlike simple interest, which calculates returns based solely on the initial principal, compound interest reinvests earned interest back into the principal. This process results in a snowball effect, where each period’s interest is calculated on an increasingly larger amount, leading to exponential growth over time.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, consider an investment of ₹100 at an annual interest rate of 6%, compounded yearly. The table below compares the growth of this investment under simple and compound interest over five years.\n\n",

		"text": "Identifying such businesses\n\nBefore starting a new business venture, its important to weight its pros and cons. No business can promise 100% profitability. A lot of businesses experience sinusoidal growth curves, where revenue does not follow a predictable path. Instead, it goes through regular cycles of increase and decrease like waves. These waves can represent various factors like revenues peaking during busy seasons and dipping during slow periods.\n\nFor instance, agriculture and farming is one such sector that has surprisingly gained significant popularity amongst the newer generation. According to India's Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, 45.5% of the country's workforce was employed in agriculture in 2021–2022. This means that a substantial portion of India's workforce is involved in this sector, contributing around 17% of the country's GDP. However, agriculture is a highly risky venture since most crops are climate-dependent, and income varies with seasonal harvests and market prices.\n\nFreelance professionals also face fluctuating income based on the availability of projects. The freedom to work independently, free from the constraints of a traditional office, is gaining a lot of popularity. In fact by 2025, freelancers are expected to constitute 50% of India's workforce. However, during periods of less or no work, the uncertainty about the future can be daunting for them too. This is why having savings is crucial.\n\nSimilarly, revenue in the tourism and hospitality sectors spikes during peak seasons and drops during off-seasons. COVID-19 pandemic is one such great example. A report by the International Monetary Fund states that Seychelles benefited from increased tuna exports during the pandemic. But these additional earnings were only a fraction of what they earn from tourism.\n\nConsumers tend to shift their spending patterns and behaviors, often in unpredictable ways, which also impacts how the retail businesses operate. This industry typically sees a surge in sales during festivals or holidays but slows down at other times, making it highly sensitive to market fluctuations. As a result, the retail sector is often the most heavily impacted during periods of economic uncertainty. Profits are not guaranteed for all 12 months of the year in any of these sectors.",

		"text": "People climb to the top of a bridge damaged when Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique in 2019. Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images\n\nThese days, itâs hard to escape news stories discussing how climate change is contributing to extreme weather disasters, including the recent U.S. hurricanes. Aid agencies are increasingly worried about the widespread damage.\n\nA growing question as these disasters worsen in a warming world is how to pay for recoveries, particularly in poorer countries that have contributed the least to climate change.\n\nI am a climate scientist who researches disasters, and I work with disaster managers on solutions to deal with the increasing risk of extreme events. The usual sources of disaster aid funding havenât come close to meeting the need in hard-hit countries in recent years. So, groups are developing new ways to meet the need more effectively. In some cases, they are getting aid to countries before the damage occurs.\n\nDisaster aid funds arenât meeting growing need\n\nCountries have a few ways that they typically send money and aid to other countries that need help when disasters hit. They can send direct government-to-government aid, contribute to aid coordinated by the United Nations, or support disaster response efforts by groups like the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n\nHowever, the support from these systems is almost never enough.\n\nIn 2023, the amount of humanitarian funding through the U.N. was about US$22 billion. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that countries hit hard by disasters actually needed about $57 billion in U.N. humanitarian aid. This does not even include the costs borne directly by disaster-affected people and their governments.\n\nTo help address damages specifically from climate change, the global community agreed at the U.N. climate conference in 2022 to create a new method â a Loss and Damage Fund. Loss and damage is generally defined as consequences of climate change that go beyond what people are able to adapt to.\n\nThe goal of the fund is for countries that historically have done the most to cause climate change to provide funding to other countries that did little to cause it yet are experiencing increasing climate-related disasters.\n\nSo far, however, the Loss and Damage Fund is tiny compared to the cost of climate-related disasters. As of late September 2024, total pledges to the Loss and Damage Fund were about US$700 million. According to one estimate, the costs directly attributable to climate change, including loss of life, are over $100 billion per year.\n\nOne goal of the 2024 U.N. climate conference, underway Nov. 11-22 in Azerbaijan, is to increase those contributions.\n\nSending aid before the disasters hit\n\nIn response to these growing needs, the disaster management community is getting creative about how it helps countries finance disaster risk reduction and response.\n\nTraditionally, humanitarian funding arrives after a disaster happens, when photos and videos of the horrible event encourage governments to contribute financial support and a needs assessment has been completed.\n\nHowever, with todayâs technology, itâs possible to forecast many climate-related disasters before they happen, and there is no reason for the humanitarian system to wait to respond until after the disaster happens.\n\nA global network of aid groups and researchers I work with has been developing anticipatory action systems designed to make funding available to countries when an extreme event is forecast but before the disaster hits.\n\nThis can allow countries to provide cash for people to use for evacuation when a flood is forecast, open extra medical services when a heat wave is expected, or distribute drought-tolerant seeds when a drought is forecast, for example.\n\nInsurance that pays out early to avoid harm\n\nGroups are also developing novel forms of insurance that can provide predictable finance for these changing catastrophes.\n\nTraditional insurance can be expensive and slow to assess individual claims. One solution is âindex insuranceâ that pays out based on drought information without needing to wait to assess the actual losses.\n\nAfrican nations created an anticipatory drought insurance product that can pay out when the drought starts happening, without waiting for the end of the season to come and the crops to fail. This could, in theory, allow farmers to replant with a drought-resilient crop in time to avoid a failed harvest.\n\nWithout insurance, disaster-affected people usually bear the costs of disaster. Therefore, experts recommend insurance as a critical part of an overall strategy for climate change adaptation.\n\nBoosting social protection systems\n\nAnother promising area of innovation is the design of social services that can scale up when needed for extreme weather events.\n\nThese are called climate-smart social protection systems. For example, existing programs that provide food for low-income families can be scaled up during and after a drought to ensure that people have sufficient and nutritious food during the climate shock.\n\nThis requires government coordination among the variety of social services offered, and it offers promise to support vulnerable communities in the face of the rising number of extreme weather events.\n\nFuture of the Loss and Damage Fund\n\nTo complement these innovative disaster risk finance mechanisms, aid from other countries is crucial, and the Loss and Damage Fund is a key part of that.\n\nThere are still many areas of debate around the U.N.âs Loss and Damage Fund and what counts as true financial support. There have been discussions over whether investing in a countryâs resilience to future disasters counts, whether existing financial systems should be used to channel finance to countries in need, and what damages are truly beyond the limits to adaptation and qualify.\n\nThe new Loss and Damage Fund is only of a part of a mosaic of initiatives that is seeking to address climate disasters.\n\nThese novel mechanisms to finance disaster risk are exciting, but they ultimately need to be created in conjunction with investments in adaptation and resilience so that extreme weather events cause less damage when they happen. Communities will need to plant different crops, build flood drainage systems and live in adaptive buildings. Managing climate risk requires a variety of innovative solutions before, during and after disaster events.\n\nErin Coughlan de Perez, Professor of Climate Risk Management, Tufts University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Though not unheard of, such skin conditions are extremely rare.\n\nAdditionally, seasonal changes can hamper skin recovery if one is too sensitive, says Ahuja. Itching due to weather changes is normal. If you get acne or inflammation on your tattoo, sometimes common in people who take too many supplements, do not pick on it, she further mentions. If it persists, consult a dermatologist instead.\n\nIf there are still problems with your tattoo recovery, here are some points that Ahuja lists down as possible reasons:\n\n● Not washing or cleaning plasma properly at the sight of the tattoo.\n\n● Not following aftercare advised by the tattoo artist.\n\n● Picking the scab while healing or itching too hard.\n\n● The tattoo artist going too deep into the skin.\n\n● Proper hygiene not being followed at one or more steps of the process.",

While experts have frequently questioned the delay of the 2021 census, the government has provided no official statement or satisfactory response for it.\n\nA Lancet editorial published earlier this year also noted, \"The 2021 census was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for the first time in 150 years, a whole decade has gone by with no official comprehensive data on India or its people...a promise that the next census will be an electronic survey carried out in 2024 is yet to be fulfilled.\"",

		"text": "But, while there are many people in Lebanon who do not support Hezbollah and its activities in south Lebanon, the IDF should remember the past. Even if sentiment against Hezbollah is high today, indiscriminate bombing of the kind we are currently witnessing in Lebanon will not be tolerated by the population indefinitely.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in 1982, when the IDF invaded south Lebanon, some Lebanese welcomed them with rice and flowers – viewing them as liberators from the PLO. But that welcome did not last long.\n\nIn 2006, the IDF applied a similar strategy, targeting civilian evacuation convoys and UN compounds. And once again, the tide of public opinion swiftly swung back in favour of “al-muqawimah” (the resistance).\n\nThe stated IDF aim is to drive Hezbollah back north of the Litani river, to force it to comply with UN resolution 1701 and allow displaced people in northern Israel to return to their homes. But it is naive of Israel and the IDF to think that an invasion or a bombing campaign, no matter how successful in the short term, will enable Israeli civilians to live in peace along the \"Blue Line\" for the long term.\n\nUltimately, the only way forward is for both parties to come to the table and negotiate. The human cost of Israel’s current strategy in Lebanon is appalling to contemplate, and in all likelihood will create more hatred – fostering a new generation of anti-Israel fighters, rather than creating the basis for a durable peace.",

		"text": "As the Mahayuti alliance inches closer to a landslide victory in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, incumbent CM Eknath Shinde stated that, just as the alliance fought the elections together, they will collectively decide on the CM face once the final results are declared on Saturday.\n\nHe also thanked his party workers and expressed gratitude to the voters.\n\nThe incumbent CM said, “Let the final results come in… Then, in the same way as we fought elections together, all three parties will sit together and take a decision (on who will be the CM).”\n\n“I thank the voters of Maharashtra. This is a landslide victory. I had said before that Mahayuti will get a thumping victory. I thank all sections of society and all the workers of the Mahayuti parties,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrations were seen at Shinde’s residence in Thane, with bouquets arriving and Shiv Sena workers cheering outside. Shiv Sena MP and Shinde’s son, Shrikant Shinde, were also seen celebrating with fellow party members.\n\nSpeaking on the victory, Shrikant Shinde said, “As we had expected, we have got very good numbers. I thank all the voters who stood behind Mahayuti and gave this landslide victory.”\n\nThe Mahayuti alliance is on its way to a landslide victory in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, crossing the crucial majority mark, winning one seat and leading in over 200 seats as of 1:00 PM. Sweets were also seen being brought to the residence of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis. Meanwhile, the BJP’s Mumbai office was abuzz with joy, with party workers bringing sweets in anticipation of a resounding victory.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, BJP leader Vikas Pathak commented on the ECI trends. He said, “We were expecting over 160 seats for Mahayuti, and that is exactly how it’s shaping up. The lead could increase further. This year has been significant for BJP. On its strength, the BJP is crossing 100 seats, and a Mahayuti Chief Minister is set to take office.”\n\nHe further noted the enthusiasm among party workers, saying, “At the moment, every party and its workers believe their party member should become the Chief Minister. Similarly, each worker of the BJP feels that the Chief Minister should be from their party. Sweets have arrived, however, the final celebrations will not happen until the conclusive results are out and our senior leaders arrive.”\n\nPathak added, “This has been the tradition. Leaders like Devendra Fadnavis and possibly Maharashtra BJP Chief Pawan Bawankule, if in Mumbai, will join the celebrations once results are confirmed.”\n\nMeanwhile, celebrations have also started in Baramati, where Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar is leading by 15,382 votes. Supporters were seen bursting crackers to mark the moment. At Devagiri, Nationalist Congress Party’s National President and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Dada Pawar, National Working President MP Praful Patel, and State President MP Sunil Tatkare were also seen participating in the celebrations.\n\nReacting to the results, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate admitted, “Maharashtra election results are opposite to our (Congress’) expectations. There is no doubt we could have done better. Our campaign was good, but maybe the public expects more from us, and we will deliver on their expectations.”\n\nIn response to the results, Shiv Sena UBT leader Sanjay Raut said, “This cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra. We know what the people of Maharashtra want…”\n\nHis comments were met by criticism from the BJP, with party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla lashing out at the Aghadi alliance. “When anyone loses, they start making excuses for their defeat…In Maharashtra, we have worked for the poor, upliftment of women, and enhancing the heritage of farmers…Today, the government under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi is going to be formed in Maharashtra with a huge majority,” he said.\n\nAs the Sena-BJP-NCP celebrate, all eyes will now be on who will assume the post of CM of the state.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

		"text": "The indictment of Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani by the US Department of Justice has given ammunition to the opposition parties to attack the Modi government. However, in desperation to establish their narrative that somehow Adani is corrupt because the US said so and PM Modi is also involved, Congress spokesperson Ajay Verma invited embarrassment and ridicule to his party on National television.\n\nDuring a debate program on the Adani indictment issue on Doordarshan News on 21st November, Congress spokesperson Ajay Verma tried to push the opposition’s narrative that PM Modi and Gautam Adani are ‘very close’. To do so, the Congress spokesperson showed a picture on his mobile phone to the Television screen, which he thought was of Gautam Adani and PM Modi. However, the debate panellists were in splits as it turned to a picture of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband Robert Vadra with Adani. Appearing as a guest on the debate OnlyFact India’s founder Vijay Patel said, “This photo is with Jija Ji (Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law,) not Modiji”.\n\nCongress leader exposing brother in law of Rahul Gandi in the show of @RheemaParashar Ji😂\n\n\n\nCC: @zoo_bear 🤡 pic.twitter.com/uKGsFTpwHW — Vijay Patel🇮🇳 (@vijaygajera) November 21, 2024\n\nThe Adani-Vadra photo mistakenly shown by Verma was taken in 2009, when Robert Vadra visited Adani’s port and SEZ in Mundra shortly after the UPA government returned to power. As per an HT report, Vadra’s visit was facilitated by a union minister, who was close to the Adani group.\n\nNotably, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and seven other executives had been accused in connection with an alleged plot to bribe Indian officials. US authorities claim that $250 million (Rs 2100 crore) in bribes were paid to certain Indian officials in exchange for preferential terms on solar power contracts obtained by Adani Green Energy Ltd and Azure Power Global Ltd.\n\nWhile the Congress party and the leftist ecosystem have already believed and are passing off the US Justice Department’s ‘allegations’ against Adanis as proven truth, the US Department of Justice has accused Gautam Adani of bribing Indian government officials in various state governments between the years 2021 to 2022, of which not a single state was ruled by Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). In fact, all the states mentioned in the indictment document were ruled by the anti-BJP parties at that time. In Tamil Nadu, I.N.D.I. Alliance partner DMK was and continues to be in power, in Odisha Biju Janata Dal (BJD) was in power, in Chhattisgarh Congress was in power, and in Andhra Pradesh, YSR Congress Party was in power between Jul 2021 and Feb 2022.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention Rahul Gandhi’s fixation with businessman Gautam Adani. Not a day goes by when the Gandhi scion does not say something slandering the businessman and accuses PM Modi of crony capitalism. The Gandhi scion and Congress party has over the last few years gone all out to implicate Adani as a partner in crime with PM Modi. In this line, he even coined terms like ‘Modani’ and claimed that PM Modi is ‘employed’ by Gautam Adani. The Congress party, however, fails to explain that if they are so convinced that Gautam Adani is corrupt and the Modi government treats him favourably, why the Congress government in Telangana signed four MoUs worth Rs 12,400 crore with the Adani group at the sideline of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2024 in Davos, Switzerland.",

		"title": "BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla exposes INDI bloc for hypocrisy over Adani row",
		"text": "On 21st November, Bharatiya Janata Party national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla exposed the hypocrisy of the opposition parties, including Congress, in a debate with India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai over the recent allegations against Indian business conglomerate Gautam Adani. He drew attention to the fact that the opposition parties have been on good terms with businessmen whenever and wherever they’ve held power, awarding him projects but accusing him of corruption and attacking the saffron party when BJP-ruled states do the same.\n\nHe countered, “If Rahul Gandhi’s allegations are to be taken at face value, he is saying two things: Adani is completely corrupt and he has colluded with anti-national forces. By that logic how could you give any project to this man anywhere in the country including Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh (when Congress was in Power)? Adani’s visit to Sharad Pawar’s residence should be the most egregious offence. Tomorrow, he (Rahul Gandhi) should not sit with Sharad Pawar.\n\nPoonawalla further pointed out, “You asked Supriya Shrinate a lot of questions but you didn’t ask her when Adani acquired the Mundra port.? When he did get the six SECIs (Solar Energy Corporation of India) that she was just screaming about. When did he enter the power sector and become the biggest power player? When did he get his first coal mine which was outside India? All during the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) tenure.”\n\nHe highlighted the blatant hypocrisy and stated, “I am not defending Adani. I am saying that if he is considered corrupt or has done something wrong then what allows the chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) to invite him and hand over Tajpur Port in West Bengal? If he is corrupt how come he is corrupt in one part of the country and not others? When Dighi Port was handed over to him by Uddhav Thackeray was he corrupt or not? Thirdly, I want to ask you a very specific question. The TMC (All India Trinamool Congress never demanded a JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). I am reading an official statement of Derek O’Brien, ‘I appeal to the state governments to probe the Adani Group wherever they have a project.’ It is their stand.”\n\nTaking Rahul Gandhi, Rajdeep, Supriya Shrinate and TMC to the cleaners on Adani issue pic.twitter.com/h7xcUBtp7X — Shehzad Jai Hind (Modi Ka Parivar) (@Shehzad_Ind) November 21, 2024\n\nOn 21st November, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi demanded the immediate arrest of Gautam Adani and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting him. “It is now pretty clear and established that Adani has broken both Indian law and American law. I am wondering why Adani is running around as a free man in this country. It is a vindication of what we have been saying. The PM is protecting Adani and the PM is involved in corruption with Adani,” he claimed.\n\n“American investigations have found him culpable in a Rs 2,000 crore scam. He should be arrested immediately. Madhabi Buch (SEBI chairperson) who has been protecting Adani should be arrested too,” he declared at a press conference in Delhi.\n\nUS prosecutors including Breon Peace with ties to anti-India billionaire Geroge Soros have charged Gautam Adani, his nephew and others with masterminding a USD 265 million bribery conspiracy to obtain state energy contracts between 2020 and 2024, drawing harsh accusations of corruption against the Adani Group, one of the country’s biggest corporations. However, the accusations have been deemed “baseless” by the Adani Group. The development has kicked a political storm in India with the opposition trying to exploit the opportunity for petty political gains.",

		"title": "Adani indictment in US court: How the Congress Party is scoring self goals, and amplifying outrage over mere allegations",
		"text": "On Thursday (21st November), the US Attorney’s Office in the eastern district of New York said that Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and seven other executives had been accused in connection with an alleged years-long plot to bribe Indian officials. US authorities claim that $250 million (Rs 2100 crore) in bribes were paid to certain Indian officials in exchange for preferential terms on solar power contracts obtained by Adani Green Energy Ltd and Azure Power Global Ltd.\n\nIn the indictment, eight executives have been named, including three from the Adani Group—Gautam Adani: Chair of the Adani Group. Sagar Adani: Nephew of Gautam Adani and head of Adani Green Energy, Vineet S. Jaain: CEO of Adani Green Energy. It also names two former CEOs of Azure Power—Ranjit Gupta: CEO from July 2019 to April 2022. Rupesh Agarwal: CEO from August 2022 to July 2023. Moreover, three former executives of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), a Canadian pension fund managing $450 billion in assets—Cyril Cabanes: Former managing director of infrastructure for Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, Saurabh Agarwal: Former managing director, CDPQ India, Deepak Malhotra: Former director of infrastructure for South Asia have also been named in the indictment as defendants.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the news of Gautam Adani being accused of bribing government officials and conspiring to commit securities fraud has the Indian opposition parties and their supportive ecosystem on cloud nine. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh went a step ahead and claimed that Congress’s constant targeting and hate campaign under the garb of demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation against Gautam Adani has been ‘vindicated’.\n\n“The indictment of Gautam Adani and others by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) of the US vindicates the demand that the Indian National Congress has been making since Jan 2023 for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the various Modani scams. The INC had asked a hundred questions in its Hum Adani ke Hain (HAHK) series bringing out the various dimensions of these scams and of the intimate nexus that has existed between the PM and his favourite businessman. These questions have remained unanswered. The SEC’s actions also cast poor light on the manner in which its Indian counterpart, namely SEBI, has gone about investigating violations of securities and other laws by the Adani Group and its abject failure to hold the Group to account for the source of its investments, shell companies, etc,” Ramesh posted on X.\n\nThe indictment of Gautam Adani and others by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) of the US vindicates the demand that the Indian National Congress has been making since Jan 2023 for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the various Modani scams.

Adani forgot that US is not ruled by Modi where he could rely upon a pliant ED, SEBI& CBI to get away with anything. #Modani.”\n\nAdanis indictment in the US is for 5 counts massive bribery & fraud; & relies on irrefutable electronic evidence.

Is the Indian opposition doing a self-goal by attacking Adani?\n\nWhile the Congress party and the leftist ecosystem have already believed and are passing off the US Justice Department’s ‘allegations’ against Adanis as proven truth, it is pertinent to understand that Gautam Adani and other defendants are innocent till the charges against them are proven. The indictment document itself mentions that “the charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.” Also, the timing of the indictment raises the question if the US is trying to stop Gautam Adani from raising capital by levelling allegations of bribery in India.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that the US Department of Justice has accused Gautam Adani of bribing Indian government officials in various state governments between the years 2021 to 2022, of which not a single state was ruled by Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). In fact, all the states mentioned in the indictment document were ruled by the anti-BJP parties at that time. In Tamil Nadu, I.N.D.I. Alliance partner DMK was and continues to be in power, in Odisha Biju Janata Dal (BJD) was in power, in Chhattisgarh Congress was in power, and in Andhra Pradesh, YSR Congress Party was in power between Jul 2021 and Feb 2022.\n\nThe indictment states that US and Indian companies committed to supply 12 GW of power to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). This was contingent on SECI entering into a Power Purchase Agreement with State Electricity Distribution Companies (SDCs). Adani Green Energy partnered with Azure Power, a US renewable energy company, and Azure was allocated 4 GW, while Adani Green Energy was allocated 8 MW. The SDCs refused to purchase power because it was too expensive. Between July 21 and February 22, Adani Green Energy (in cooperation with Azure Power, a US corporation) paid the equivalent of US $265 million to SDCs situated in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAllegations are of 2021 to 2022\n\n\n\nFollowing parties were in power then\n\n\n\nOdisha – BJD\n\nTamil Nadu- DMK and Congress\n\nAndhra Pradesh- YSRCP\n\nChattisgarh- Congress\n\n\n\nSo Congress in 2 states took bribe to give work to Adani? https://t.co/tEnnlqz7BL pic.twitter.com/tqwkX39dmz — Ankur Singh (@iAnkurSingh) November 21, 2024\n\nPoint number 21 of the indictment says, “The Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited, GRIDCO Limited, Jammu Kashmir Power Corporation Limited, Andhra Pradesh Central Power Distribution Corporation Limited, Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited and Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (collectively, the “State Distribution Companies”) were electricity distribution companies in India that were state-owned and state-controlled and performed functions that the state governments in India treated as their own. The State Distribution Companies were “instrumentalities” of the Indian government, and their officers and employees were “foreign officials,” as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1(f)(1)(A) and 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).”\n\nAs per the US Justice Department, after making the alleged promise of bribes to Indian officials of the mentioned state government, around July 2021 and February 2022, electricity distribution companies for the states and regions of Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into PSAs with SECI with Andhra Pradesh purchasing the maximum amount of solar power.\n\n“Following the promise of bribes to Indian government officials, in or about and between July 2021 and February 2022, electricity distribution companies for the states and regions of Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh entered into PSAs with SECI under the Manufacturing Linked Project. Andhra Pradesh’s electricity distribution companies entered into a PSA with SECI on or about December 1, 2021, pursuant to which the state agreed to purchase approximately seven gigawatts of solar power- by far the largest amount of any Indian state or region,” the indictment document states.\n\nIt further claims that in or about and between October 2021 and February 2022, the U.S. Issuer and the Indian Energy Company, through subsidiaries, executed PPAs with SECI. “Pursuant to the PPAs, the U.S. Issuer agreed to supply SECI with approximately 650 megawatts of solar power for the Indian states and region of Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir (collectively, the “650 MW PPAs”) and approximately 2.3 gigawatts of solar power for the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (the “2.3 GW PPAs”). Subsidiaries for the Indian Energy Company, likewise, executed their own PPAs with SECI under which the subsidiaries agreed to supply SECI with solar power for the Indian states and region of Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh. Following the execution of the Andhra Pradesh-linked PPAs by the Indian Energy Company’s subsidiaries, the Indian Energy Company issued a press release quoting GAUTAM S. ADANI, who touted the signing of “the world’s largest PPA with SECI,” the indictment document reads.\n\nExcerpts taken from Adani Indictment document (Source: US Justice Department)\n\nNotably, the press release mentioned in the indictment document was issued by AGEL in December 2021, in which it had said that AGEL has signed an “agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to supply 4,667 MW of green power. This is the world’s largest ever green power purchase agreement.” The press release further mentioned that the AGEL-SECI agreement to supply 4,667 MW is part of a manufacturing-linked solar tender of 8,000 MW awarded to AGEL by SECI in June 2020. “So far, AGEL has signed PPAs with SECI for a total generation capacity of close to 6000 MW of the 8,000 MW awarded in 2020. AGEL expects to close the balance 2000 MW PPA in the next two to three months,” the press release reads.\n\nEven if it is believed that bribery allegations levelled against the Adani Group are somehow true, the Congress party and other opposition parties should answer why their state government purchased power from AGEL since they have long been accusing Gautam Adani of being close to Prime Minister Modi and taking favours from the BJP government in Centre. Also, Congress, DMK, BJD and YSRCP should answer if they accepted bribes from the Adani Group since anything the US says is a universal truth for the anti-BJP parties.\n\nRahul Gandhi demands Adani’s arrest, based on mere allegations in a US court\n\nSounding like a US deep state stooge, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi demanded Gautam Adani’s arrest merely because an American probe agency is saying so, as if India is a US colony.\n\n\"US agency is saying Adani has done a crime so point is why's he not in jail?\"\n\n\n\nRahul Gandhi has got an impromptu assignment by class-teacher, using words Adani, Modi, and Jail.\n\n\n\nBtw the clown himself is on bail under National Herald scam of ₹750 cr. pic.twitter.com/L45hv12O43 — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) November 21, 2024\n\nAnother baseless noise before the Winter Session of Parliament?\n\nBesides, the timing of the indictment is also questionable as it comes right ahead of the winter session of the parliament. Many crucial bills are likely to be tabled during the session, including the much-debated Waqf Amendment Bill. Just as it was seen during the Hindenburg-Adani episode, the opposition parties went berserk against the ruling dispensation accusing them of being complicit in the Adani Group’s alleged ‘stock manipulation’ and ‘fraudulent’ market practices, however, a Supreme Court-appointed six-member committee eventually said in its report that there was “no evident pattern of manipulation” in Adani’s group of companies and there was also no regulatory failure. In January this year, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea asking for a probe by the CBI into the allegations against the Adani group.\n\nIt appears that after the Haryana debacle, it is being said that Adani’s indictment is an effort by the US deep state to keep Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party’s perennial PM aspirant relevant in headlines. And given the timing of the indictment, it seems that controversy around the Adani group is being stirred to bring down the Indian stock market and hand the opposition an issue to stall the parliament. Notably, Adani Group stocks fell as much as 20% when trading resumed in Indian equity markets on Thursday.\n\nThe Adani indictment seems to be the US deep state and the outgoing Democrat administration’s last-ditch effort to tarnish India’s image and thus the Indo-US ties given Gautam Adani’s supposed liking for the President-elect Donald Trump. It was reported earlier that after Trump’s historic win, Gautam Adani announced a whopping $10 billion investment in US energy and infrastructure projects which would generate nearly 15000 jobs. Trump had earlier said he would ease the restrictions on energy production as well as expedite project approvals.\n\nAdani Group responds to indictment by US Justice Department\n\nIn an exchange filing on Thursday, Adani Green Energy Limited said, “The United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have issued a criminal indictment and brought a civil complaint, respectively, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, against our Board members, Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani. The United States Department of Justice have also included our Board member, Vneet Jaain, in such criminal indictment. In light of these developments, our subsidiaries have presently decided not to proceed with the proposed USD-denominated bond offerings.”\n\nMeanwhile, an Adani Group spokesperson rubbished allegations levelled against the Directors of ‘Adani Green’ by the US Department of Justice and the SEC. “The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,” it stated. The Indian conglomerate further stated that all legal recourse is being sought.",

		"text": "Violence was perpetrated by a Muslim mob alleging obstruction in voting during the Meerapur assembly by-election in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh on 20th November. Many videos of the incident went viral on social media and a police inspector is seen holding a pistol in his hand in one of the clips. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav called it an attempt to intimidate voters and demanded the suspension of the inspector. However, Muzaffarnagar police countered these allegations and netizens also accused him of lying.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav shared a 28-second video on 20th November in which several women are seen standing in front of the policemen. They are asking the cops not to fire bullets and assuring them to stop something immediately. At the same time, a police inspector can be heard warning some people standing far away while holding a pistol. Several stones are spotted on the road. “Election Commission should immediately suspend SHO (Station House Officer) of Kakarwali police station area of ​​Meerapur because he is stopping voters from casting their votes by threatening them with a revolver,” he posted. He tagged several handles including Election Commission in his tweet.\n\nNetizens slam the SP chief\n\nPeople have put the truth in front of Akhilesh Yadav as multiple netizens uploaded the full video of the incident which is 1 minute 48 seconds below his tweet. The mob can be seen rioting and attacking the policemen. Many women are standing on the roofs of houses. Cops are taking cover behind the walls to escape the assault. A policeman is seen trying to chase away the rioters with a pistol in his hand as the footage ends.\n\nक्लिप कटवा है यह भी — Rohit Jain (@Rohitjain2799) November 20, 2024\n\nThe reality of the matter\n\nThe name of the police inspector seen in the video is Rajiv Sharma. He is currently SHO Kakaroli. Muzaffarnagar police termed Akhilesh Yadav’s tweet as a conspiracy. Muzaffarnagar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) IPS Abhishek Singh stated that an edited portion of a long video is being shared as part of a well-planned conspiracy. He described Sharma’s action as an attempt to control the situation. He said that action is underway and a case has been registered against the miscreants.\n\nIn fact, according to IPS Abhishek Singh, the police arrived at the location after receiving reports of conflict between two parties. Some began trying to block the route as soon as the police arrived. As the police attempted to remove the road barricade, the attackers started hurling stones at them. The police used the necessary force to quell this violence. The rioters left the area once the police intervened, and put the women forward.\n\nAccording to the information gathered by OpIndia, there was also an effort to bring cell phones into the polling station during the Meerapur assembly by-election in addition to traffic blockages and stone pelting. Abdullah, the son of Arshad Rana, the candidate for Asaduddin Owaisi’s party All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in the Meerapur assembly, attempted to enter the booth with a mobile phone. When the police stopped him, he started quarreling. However, Abdullah’s clamor did not affect the police and he had to go to the booth without a mobile phone.",

		"title": "Gautam Adani bribery case: Read about Attorney Breon Peace's ties to George Soros",
		"text": "Gautam Adani and seven other individuals have been charged by the United States authorities for bribing Indian officials to secure solar power contracts with state electricity distribution businesses. The lawsuit involves allegations that the chairperson of the Adani Group, his nephew Sagar Adani, and six other individuals paid bribes to Indian government officials totaling Rs 2,029 crore ($265 million) between 2020 to 2024.\n\nThe others who have been accused are Adani Group’s executive Vineet Jain, Azure employees Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, along with ex-employees of a Canadian institutional investor (CDPQ) Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal, and Deepak Malhotra.\n\nThe Adani Group was also accused of not disclosing these details to the US banks and investors from whom it raised billions for its solar power project. The Indian multinational conglomerate reportedly aimed at raking in $2 billion in profits by securing the energy contracts.\n\nThe charges were presented against them by Breon Stacey Peace, who is the 48th United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued against Gautam Adani in the case.\n\nThe Adani group was initially subjected to the fraudulent allegations by Hindenburg Research, followed by Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) hitjob, and now the latest trial. Adani has been accused for the third time of adopting unethical methods to further its business interests and notably, the billionaire and self-proclaimed philanthropist George Soros has cast a large shadow in each of the three events.\n\nThe Hungarian-American jew and his Open Society Foundations have frequently been associated with regime changes. He is often regarded as an agent of chaos and disruption because of his disregard for democratic processes and imposing his will on people by dubious means.\n\nNow, in the latest incident Breon Peace who claimed, “As alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vineet S. Jain lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,” while accusing the Adani Group and others has also been discovered to have a connection with George Soros, hinting at a larger conspiracy to yet again damage the Indian industrialist’s reputation and business.\n\nWhat is the link between George Soros and Breon Peace\n\nBreon Peace’s spouse Jacqueline Jones-Peace is the Director of Development & Senior Attorney at Equal Justice Initiative, which is based in Montgomery, Alabama. The non-profit and human rights organisation was founded by Bryan Stevenson who also serves as its Executive Director. However, the interesting part is that he is also a member of the Open Society Foundations US Programs board, which establishes an evident relationship between the Peace couple and George Soros. It undoubtedly indicates that there is something sinister going on behind the scenes to target the Adani Group through their nefarious alliance.\n\nMajority Leader of the United States Senate Chuck Schumer, who had longstanding ties to George Soros and his family, publicly supported Breon Peace’s judicial appointment and played a key part in it in 2021. Chuck Schumer supports a number of Soros family initiatives. Left-wing billionaires, including George Soros, had contributed significantly to a super political action committee (PAC) supporting Chuck Schumer in order to help the attempts made by the Democratic Party to maintain Senate control ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nOn 22nd June, Soros-primarily funded Democracy PAC II. He contributed $2.5 million to Senate Majority PAC on 22nd June, bringing its total donations to $6 million over the past three years, following $3.5 million in 2022 and $2.5 million in 2021. He donated 16 million to PAC in 2024.\n\nGeorge Soros and his attempts to bring down The Adani Group\n\nGeorge Soros, his organizations, and their ecosystem have attempted to hurt the Indian firm in the past as well in an attempt to undermine the Indian economy and, consequently, the Modi government. On 16th February 2023, George Soros launched a vicious attack on the Indian government by exploiting the Adani-Hindenburg controversy. “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined. Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was charged by him with engaging in crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he declared. The Hindenburg Research report’s “shakedown” of the Indian markets, according to the billionaire, will lead to “much needed institutional reforms” and a “democratic revival” in India.\n\nMoreover, the Bharatiya Janata Party also mentioned that George Soros is the primary investor in the US short-seller Hindenburg while slamming the Congress party including Rahul Gandhi for plotting to sow chaos and instability in the nation. “Whose investment is there in Hindenburg? Do you know this gentleman George Soros who regularly runs propaganda against India? He is the main investor there. In their pathological hatred against Narendra Modi, the Congress Party today has developed hatred against India itself,” charged Ravi Shankar Prasad on 12th August.\n\nThe Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) which released a report last year targetting the Adani Group has Open Society Foundations among its major supporters. It provided the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project with a minimum grant of $8,00,000 (Rs 6.61 crores) in order to “strengthen” the organization’s cross-border reporting and expand its reach. This is consistent with the standard strategy used by George Soros and his Open Society Foundations to sway civil society and “distort” public opinion in many countries. He has repeatedly attempted to damage India’s reputation internationally via the organizations he funds including Freedom House and the V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute.\n\nFurthermore, Anand Mangnale, the South Asian (Regional) Editor of OCCRP, worked as a partnerships and strategy consultant for NewsClick, a controversial left-wing propaganda website funded by China. The official website stated, “Anand has worked on several investigations exposing corporate and government corruption, abuse of power, and government misinformation and fake news campaigns,” and added, “Anand was a partnerships and strategy consultant with online news platform Newsclick.in, focusing on exposing corporate fraud and corruption.”\n\nGeorge Soros’ brazen effort to influence US presidential election\n\nGeorge Soros bought a massive stake in the second-largest radio company, “Audacy”, which owned more than 220 stations nationwide and had 165 million listeners monthly, only few weeks before elections in the United States, alarming many lawmakers and officials including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner who was appointed by Donald Trump.\n\n“Under existing FCC rules, foreign company ownership of US radio stations is not supposed to exceed 25%. George Soros used foreign investment to make his bid and then made a filing asking the commission to make an exception to the usual review process, according to public documents. The FCC decision to fast-track his deal is the first time in modern history such a deal has been approved by the full Commission without first running the national security review process, a process that could take up to a year or more,” according to reports.\n\nThe FCC’s suspicious handling of George Soros’ moves was raised by Republican Congressman Chip Roy of Texas back in April. He pointed to a communications law that prohibited companies with over 25% foreign ownership from holding a radio license, significantly hampering the latter’s intention to acquire the radio network. His disclosures came a few months after the businessman had already invested almost $400 million in Audacy.\n\nChip Roy stated, “But instead of going through the usual petition for declaratory ruling process, which would enable the FCC to review and assess those foreign ownership interests as part of its transaction review, the Soros group has asked the FCC to waive that process and put it off until sometime down the road,” in his letter to the FCC “indicating that those foreign stakeholders will be given special warrants in the meantime.”\n\nGeorge Soros backed attorney behind Donald Trump’s indictment\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had invoked George Soros’ name following his indictment along with other prominent Republicans, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, by a Manhattan grand jury in March of last year. The inquiry into the former’s alleged 2016 hush money transactions to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg prompted the development. Unsurprisingly, George Soros gave $1 million to the US racial rights advocacy group “Color of Change PAC” in May 2021, which subsequently extensively funded the attorney’s campaign.\n\nMoreover, the business magnate’s son Jonathan Soros and daughter Jennifer Allan Soros actively contributed to Alvin Bragg’s campaign. On 26th April 2021, Jonathan Soros contributed $10,000 cheque to the district attorney, according to state documents. Three days later, on 29th April, Jennifer Allan Soros provided $10,000 to his campaign. Despite the fact that other individuals made more direct cash contributions, the two were reportedly among the top donors to his committee.\n\nDonal Trump took to Truth Social and blasted the probe. He said, “Why won’t Bragg drop this case? Everybody says there is no crime here. I did nothing wrong. It was all made up by a convicted nut job with zero credibility, (apparently referring to Michael Dean Cohen) who has been disputed by highly respected professionals at every turn. Bragg refuses to stop despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. He is a Soros-backed animal who just doesn’t care about right or wrong no matter how many people are hurt.”\n\nHe accused that the legal system doesn’t exist and added that “this is the Gestapo, this is Russia and China, but worse. Disgraceful!”. Donald Trump then expressed that the attorney is aware of his innocence in another post and stated, “But he doesn’t care. He is just carrying out the plans of the radical left lunatics. Our country is being destroyed, as they tell us to be peaceful.”\n\nLikewise, in a fundraising email to his supporters, Donald Trump highlighted, “They’re coming for me” and clarified that “they” were “district attorneys hand-picked and personally funded by George Soros.” It is pertinent to remember that Donald Trump won with an overwhelming majority in the recently concluded elections in the United States and will become the president for the second time.\n\nGeorge Soros’ unbridled hatred towards nationalist leaders including PM Modi\n\nGeorge Soros vowed to support an initiative to combat the decline of civil society in a world increasingly dominated by “would-be and actual dictators” and climate change while speaking at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos. Attacking world leaders, he lamented that the world’s most powerful nations, the US, China, and Russia under President Vladimir Putin, were in the hands of real or potential tyrants and claimed that the number of authoritarian leaders constantly increased.\n\nThe “biggest and most frightening setback,” according to him, occurred in India, where he charged PM Modi with “creating a Hindu nationalist state.”\n\n“Nationalism, far from being reversed, made further headway. The biggest and most frightening setback occurred in India where a democratically elected Narendra Modi is creating a Hindu nationalist state, imposing punitive measures on Kashmir, a semi-autonomous Muslim region, and threatening to deprive millions of Muslims of their citizenship,” he barked while making bogus claims. To his credit, George Soros never hesitated to publicly express his opposition to India.\n\nGeorge Soros’ sinister designs\n\nGeorge Soros regularly labels conservative governments “authoritarian ” and pledges to “fight nationalists” and these governments around the world. If there is one thing he has detested the most in his life, it is India and PM Modi’s nationalist administration. He made significant progress in causing chaos in India through his Open Society Foundation, which began operations in 1999 by providing fellowships and scholarships for students to pursue research and study at Indian universities.\n\nThe left-wing international organization headed by him has started to spread its tentacles throughout the nation under the guise of charity endeavors by actively supporting anti-Indian groups that operate within India. George Soros has repeatedly demonstrated in recent decades the willingness to wage war against the Indian nationalist government through a variety of networks that he has supported, including the media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and intellectuals, among others.\n\nHis persistent attacks on Indian companies, particularly the Adani Group, show that he has uncovered a new avenue to harm India’s economy. Now, he and his cronies have focused on smear campaigns against Indian firms in an effort to destroy their wealth and thus, the fiscal health of the nation. The recent hit job on the Adani Group is another multifaceted assault against the nation, its nationalist government, and its thriving economy. George Soros wants India’s growth story to become its doom in order to overthrow the current administration and replace it with one that he fancies.",

		"title": "Watch \"The Sabarmati Report\" to uncover truth hidden behind lies",
		"text": "On April 28, 2006, a film was released that stands out for its significance. While movies are released every week, this date is notable because it marked the debut of the Hollywood film United 93, 1,721 days after the real-life event that inspired it. Remarkably, the incident was adapted for the screen in under five years. Although other films have been made on the same subject, United 93 holds a unique position due to its deeply intertwined narrative with the actual event. This authenticity brought the story to life, earning the film exceptional ratings on platforms like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.\n\nIt was such a major development that even Bollywood started making movies on the same. It was based on the terrorist attack which transpired on 11th September 2001 and targeted the World Trade Centre in the United States of America. The filmmakers, however, saw a masala venture like “My Name Is Khan” in the incident. Were the filmmakers aware of a more serious incident in our nation? Was it possible for the storytellers within them to show the event on the silver screen and reveal the truth to the public? Has our country actually experienced a tragedy worse than 9/11? The answer is “yes” and the reasoning behind it terrifies the film industry.\n\nOn 27th February 2002, 59 people were burnt alive to death and this incident was much more horrifying than 9/11. It is not because of the number of fatalities but the identity of the perpetrators. The people who carried out 9/11 were trained and had a religious mindset but those who burnt the Sabarmati Express train could be anyone from a vegetable seller to a tailor or a painter to a Maulvi-Maulana (Muslim cleric) or even a neighbor walking in the crowd, all of whom we trust.\n\nHow can a person burn someone alive to death? How is it possible to burn 59 people alive at once? The answer to such inquiries is that hatred must first reach the soul rather than the mind or heart before one can even consider committing such an act. According to the text, Islamist beliefs already include hateful notions including the killing of “kafir” (infidel), hellfire and others. However, how is this animosity possible in a Ganga-Jamuni culture? The result is that “The Sabarmati Report” has been released after 8297 days. That’s more than 22 years of wait.\n\nI apologise for not being able to write about the movie or its screenplay, music, acting, cinematography or any other thing even after so many paragraphs but I have not strayed. I didn’t want to write the review. There was no requirement for it. A lot has already been expressed from mainstream to social media. Hence, I am writing about the need for this film in our society. I’m curious as to why it took 22 years for someone to produce a movie about such a dreadful and heartbreaking event that will always be remembered in Indian history.\n\nWhy one should watch “The Sabarmati Report”\n\nIt was Sabarmati Express transporting the karsevaks from Ayodhya that was burned in Godhra.\n\nWatch this movie to learn the names of some of the 59 passengers who perished in the Sabarmati Express fire in Godhra.\n\nWatch this movie to learn about the event that split Indian history into two sections: India before and after Godhra.\n\nThe train fire was intentionally kindled by extremist Muslims rather than a spontaneous occurence of a technical issue. Watch this movie if you want to witness this reality on the big screen.\n\nIf you believe that the media portrays all facts accurately, then you should watch this movie.\n\nThe community of Ganga-Jamuni filmmakers eventually woke up even if it was after 22 years and wrote as well as filmed the truth of Godhra. Watch this movie if you wish to witness this transformation.\n\nOnly 41 of the 59 individuals who were burned alive as a result of radical Islamic ideology have had their names released to the public thus far. Who were the other eighteen unidentified people? When will the investigative journalists and filmmakers from Bollywood execute research on this and produce a documentary or movie? Do you want those 18 people to not be forgotten by just going unnoticed, or do you want the issue to become more than just a question and instead become the story of the nation? If you want this then watch this movie.\n\nWhy one shouldn’t watch “The Sabarmati Report”\n\nYou should avoid watching this movie if you want to see the visuals of the burning train because the focus of the movie is not on the train burning but on how an attempt was made to erase this inhuman incident from history. The movie centers on this media industry that propagates deceptive information.\n\nDon’t watch this movie if you want to witness the screams of those who were burned alive because the filmmakers must not have intended to further torment the families of the victims. Hence they and the fire are only a part of this project. However, a fanatic Muslim crowd was shown to plan and then set fire to two of the train’s bogies. The film then revolves around how the media nearly destroyed this information.\n\nDon’t watch this movie if you can’t tell the difference between the “two stories” that are presented in it, the lie that lies beneath the story and the reality that emerged after. This is a significant part that many moviegoers in the theater were seen to have misunderstood and even commented on. The filmmakers clearly presented two stories “Kahani-1” and “Kahani-2” and clarified that these stories were purposefully crafted to prevent the revelation of Godhra’s reality. The storyline of the Hindu boy testifying against the karsevaks in Kahani-2 and the Muslim girl being abducted by them in Kahani-1 is so compelling that, based on these two tales, the narrative that “the train caught fire on its own” was not only produced by the media of the day but it was also thought to be true in the initial probe reports. The director has demonstrated that the story itself need not be true by disclosing the fabrications of these two tales in the movie.\n\nDon’t watch this movie if you can’t comprehend the media report’s content or how the truth was revealed at the end. The fallacy of blindly relying on the media, the fourth pillar of the nation, has been dispelled by the story’s writer and director. For this reason, if one pays close attention to the script, it will be discovered that any sequence like “the train caught fire due to an accident” at the start of the movie is actually a media story. Nowhere is it stated that this is the actual reality. The filmmakers deserve a perfect score for shattering the idea that media equals truth.\n\nDon’t watch this movie if you can’t tell the difference between the cheers in the Muslim colony when the Pakistan cricket team hits a six and the scene where a small child with the skullcap celebrates India’s victory while bursting firecrackers. Some things are stated directly and some indirectly in the visual media. We must recognize this distinction as viewers. The writer is telling the hero straight out that when the Pakistan cricket team performs well, it’s usual in Muslim colonies for people to burst crackers. In contrast, the filmmaker depicts a parallel reality in which the naive youngsters of the same colony, who have not been exposed to Pakistan or extreme religious ideas, celebrate India’s success as if it were their own. We have to acknowledge the difference between portraying the mindset of a Muslim child and that of a fanatical Muslim adult or adolescent on TV.\n\nDon’t watch this movie if you can’t see the reasoning for the claim that both sides have good people. Although there is nothing wrong with this sequence, many viewers claim that the creators included it for balance, which is untrue. It can be considered this way, if some people from the other side are not honest, then who are the ones returning to the fold of Sanatan Dharma?\n\nThe plot revolves around a Hindi journalist, however, if you prefer pure Hindi in written form then avoid this movie. Indeed, the Hindi spoken in the film is accurate because it is a Hindi film, but the section where it is written in Hindi is disappointing.\n\nWhat does the director wants to convey in the controversial scenes\n\n“There are honest people on both sides.” If you are hurt by this scene, then what are your views about APJ Abdul Kalam? Will you dismiss him? Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan is in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) right now. He had protested against his own Congress party and former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi on the Shah Bano matter. So, will you reject him too? The story’s writer and director are merely trying to communicate that if there is a nice person in any section of society, they should be perceived as such. Should the makers not have the freedom to say and show even this much?\n\n“Small children wearing Muslim caps celebrating India’s victory.” It is important to note that the children shown in this scene have not reached adolescence. The director wants to show that the poison of religious fanaticism has not yet filled their minds and they are innocent. Hence, they are rejoicing in the country’s win. The same filmmaker also depicted family members of those youngsters from the same Muslim colony popping crackers and clapping when Pakistan hit a six. Do you want to stop using the visual medium to compel the audience to reflect by presenting them with completely different scenarios in parallel?\n\n“Media report and two false stories.” The director is attempting to indicate that the media has only spread incorrect information following the Sabarmati Express fire. People believe the images displayed by the media they trust to be true and that has been exposed. This movie focuses more on who planned the conspiracy and who concealed it than on who set fire to the Sabarmati Express. What is wrong with this plot point when the media is the antagonist?\n\nWhere improvement could have been made\n\nThe terrible Hindi that was written was ignored from the first disclaimer until the last sequence of gratitude. It is inexcusable given that the protagonist is proud to be a Hindi journalist and refers to himself as such throughout the movie. The producer-director should have made him do the proofreading without spending any money if he really truly knew Hindi in real life.\n\nRead the report in Hindi here.",

		"title": "Absurd blame game to divert attention from the root causes, no real solution for pollution problem in Delhi",
		"text": "Every year, from October to January, Delhi and the other northern states struggle with the air pollution brought on by multiple souces, including falling temperatures, smoke, dust, low wind speeds, vehicle emissions and, burning crop stubble.\n\nLow visibility causes flights to and from Delhi to be canceled. Schools are closed, commuters encounter severe difficulties, and everyday life turns into an upheaval task as the situation leaves everyone helpless. The visibility is extremely low and the thick blanket of smog can be even seen from space as people are left to breathe in the toxic air which can lead to hazardous health conditions.\n\nWith an AQI of 441 on 17th November, Delhi’s air quality dropped further, thereby ranking as the nation’s second most polluted city. The 24-hour Air Quality Index (AQI) for the city, which is measured every day at 4 pm, was 441 and fell into the “severe” category. The AQI was 417 a day earlier. As people grapple to cope with this terrible reality, the usual suspects prepare for their yearly blame game, which involves trying to shift accountability and secure political points rather than offering a tangible solution to the critical issue.\n\nIt is also the time for skewed-facts and full of lies research articles which might look like a sincere effort on the surface but in reality, lack a comprehensive picture, are devoid of overall numbers, and serve mainly as a political tool and furthering a particular narrative. The most recent example of the same was a ‘research’ analysis published on 15th November by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) titled, “Increased SO₂ emissions from coal-fired power plants: FGD installation should not be delayed further,” by Manojkumar N.\n\nThe report was then used by multiple media platforms including Moneycontrol, Business Today and The New Indian Express among others declaring that the air in Delhi NCR (National Capital Region) is 16 times more polluted by thermal power plants than by stubble burning.\n\nImage via Moneycontrol\n\nImage via Business Today\n\nImage via The New Indian Express\n\nPeople seized the opportunity and were the first to endorse the piece on social media as it deflected the attention away from stubble burning. Reacting to the post of the author and columnist Devinder Sharma who shared the report on X (formerly Twitter) highlighting, “So, thermal plants in Delhi emit 16 times more pollution than stubble burning,” ‘journalist’ Ravish Kumar claimed, “No one is interested in these facts. They just want to kill time. They want someone else (to blame) in every matter. It is best to make everyone beat the plate. They will be happy too.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, he yet against blamed the center and mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s request to show gratitude to health workers at the forefront of the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country during COVID-19 in 2020. He, just like the rest of his cabal, has no remedy to the problem apart from expressing his contempt for the Modi government and the people who voted for it, which was again along very predictable lines.\n\nMeanwhile, Decision Support System (DSS) for Air Quality Management had stated that “vehicular emissions contributed approximately 15.8 percent to Delhi’s pollution on Sunday.”\n\nThe system also reported that stubble burning was the main contributor to the capital’s air pollution on Saturday, accounting for 25 percent of the total pollution. “Meanwhile, the prominent pollutant was PM2.5, according to the CPCB. PM2.5 refers to fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, about the width of a human hair. These particles are so small that they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing significant health risks,” it added while concluding the article.\n\nWhat is the main point of the CREA report\n\nLet’s now concentrate on the claims made by the reports that based its findings on the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) which read, “A study conducted by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has found that thermal power plants in the national capital region (NCR) emit 16 times more air pollutants than stubble burning. Thermal power plants in NCR emit 16 times the 17.8 kilotonnes released from burning 8.9 million tonnes of paddy straw.”\n\nAccording to CREA estimates, 281 kilotonnes of sulphur dioxide (SO₂) were released by coal-fired thermal power plants in NCR between June 2022 and May 2023. It then discussed how India’s coal-dependent energy sector is the main reason for SO₂ emission, accounting for almost 20% of all anthropogenic SO₂ emissions worldwide and stated, “India’s SO₂ emissions from electricity generation were measured at 6,807 kilotonnes in 2023, surpassing emissions from other major emitters like Turkey (2,206 kilotonnes) and Indonesia (2,017 kilotonnes).”\n\n“A comparison between NCR thermal power plant emissions and paddy straw burning emissions in Punjab and Haryana highlights the scale of SO₂ pollution. Thermal power plants in NCR emit 281 kilotonnes of SO₂ annually, 16 times more than the 17.8 kilotonnes emitted by burning 8.9 million tonnes of paddy straw. While paddy straw burning causes seasonal spikes, thermal power plants represent a larger, persistent pollution source year-round, underscoring the need for stricter controls on thermal power plant emissions. Yet, thermal power plants often receive leniency and repeated compliance extensions, especially for installing FGDs, whereas stubble burning is heavily penalized, with strict enforcement on farmers during the burning season,” news reports alleged while citing CREA.\n\nBadarpur Thermal Power Station located at Badarpur area in NCT (National Capital Territory) Delhi near Faridabad. (Source: Hindustan Times)\n\nAccording to the data, burning crop residue results in a seasonal increase in pollution in Delhi-NCR, however, thermal power plants are running throughout the year. Eleven coal-based thermal power plants are located within 300 kilometers of Delhi, and one outside that area, the Goindwal Sahib Power Plant in Punjab, which is also taken into account when making decisions about the plants.\n\nThe CREA analysis undermined that if the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technology were used more rapidly, emissions in the NCR would drop to 93 kilotonnes, or 67 percent. Manojkumar, Analyst, CREA voiced, “Over 96 percent of particulate pollution from coal-fired power plants in the NCR is secondary in nature, primarily originating from SO₂. Reducing SO₂ emissions can significantly decrease the secondary particulate matter load, thereby reducing the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to these particles.”\n\nHe further conveyed, “SO₂ levels often meet the NAAQS because, once released, it quickly transforms into sulfates, secondary particles that are major components of PM2.5. These secondary particles have a longer lifetime and pose serious health risks. This hidden transformation of SO₂ into harmful particles emphasises the necessity for FGD installation.”\n\nA lopsided analysis and the sensationalization of a serious issue\n\nNo sane person would ever argue that thermal power plants don’t contribute to air pollution, but the analysis seems to be unfair and dishonest. Stubble burning usually takes place from the last week of September to November (when pollution peaks in Delhi) as compared to thermal power plants which operate throughout the year.\n\nIt is important to consider the same time period for an accurate and impartial evaluation to obtain an unbiased result regarding the larger pollutant as statistical methods and reasons could be deceptive if they aren’t utilized by researchers themselves.\n\nA source that remains operative throughout the year has been compared to another source that is active for a restricted amount of time. This effectively dilutes the contribution of a pollutant as the intensity is artificially spread over a year. It could be better understood with an example of a study that claims that ‘stubble burning is causing just 5% of total pollution (on an annual basis)’ which might appear small figure, but translates to that it is responsible for 60% of the pollution in that short period when it was present, compared to other months when it is not.\n\nFor additional clarity, comparing the results of one student’s annual examination to the other’s score on a single test cannot reliably assess the academic performance of the two pupils. It would only be feasible if they were evaluated on the same basis either through the single test or the annual exam. Therefore, it is more significant to appropriately recognise causes and information in context than it is to assign blame which is why such comparisons (whether by ‘researchers,’ activists or journalists who create headlines out of such pieces) are misleading.\n\nMost importantly, the poor quality of the air in the north during the same time as the burning of agri-residue should be enough of an indicator to stress the vast negative effect it leaves on the environment. On the other hand, farmers were reportedly found to be coming up with ways to evade satellite monitoring. Experts now think that farmers might be intentionally avoiding detection by changing the time of stubble burning.\n\nStubble burning. (Source: NewsBytes)\n\nAccording to reports, Punjab saw a sharp decline in farm fires, going from over 79,000 in 2021 to about 32,000 in 2023. The figures were derived from satellite image analysis. However, the truth surfaced soon enough that the farmers have been employing tactics to dodge satellite surveillance to give the impression that the number of stubble-burning occurrences in the state has been declining. The number of farm fire incidents in Punjab this week surpassed 7000, according to NASA scientist Hiren Jethva, with 400 new cases reported.\n\n“We use the afternoon satellite overpass time data from NASA Satellites like Suomi NPP and Aqua. They overpass the region around 1:30-2:00 pm but somehow they (farmers) have learnt that they can bypass the satellite overpass time and can burn the crop residue in the late afternoon. This is confirmed by the South Korean geostationary satellite that the majority of the crop burning happens after 2 pm once the NASA satellites overpass the region when there is no surveillance. However, the fires cannot be hidden from geostationary satellites which take a picture of the region every five minutes,” he informed.\n\nA variety of pollutants make up overall pollution, including gases like SO₂ and CO₂ as well as particles like dust and smoke. During this time of year, Delhi and other places record extremely high percentages of these particles (PM2.5 and PM10). PM2.5 are tiny particles that are roughly the width of a human hair and have a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. These are so small that they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, posing significant health risks. PM10 are coarser particles that are roughly the breadth of ten human hairs and have a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. These can aggravate respiratory issues and irritate the airways, although they are not as dangerous as PM2.5. Thermal power plants are a source of these particles but activities like stubble burning, construction dust and others are also major contributors to the same.\n\nThe invalid comparison\n\n“Despite the significant health and environmental impact of CFPP (Coal-fired power plants) emissions, regulatory enforcement on these power plants remains far less stringent compared to the seasonal restrictions and penalties imposed on stubble burning. During the stubble burning season, farmers face heavy fines and rigorous monitoring, with strict enforcement of pollution control measures. In contrast, CFPPs are often granted leniency, with delays in implementing necessary technologies like FGD and repeated extensions for compliance,” the analysis stated.\n\nPertinently, things are not as they seem on the surface. While appropriate anti-pollution regulations are established for industries, construction, automobiles and others, such norms are either absent or disregarded by farmers. A recent example of it has been the protests against Compressed Biogas (CBG) Plants which were considered to be a sustainable way to address the problem of stubble burning in the long run.\n\nHowever, only five of the thirty-eight facilities that were initially planned to be active are now operational, and none are operating at full capacity as a result of the project being stalled by ongoing farmer protests. The plants were designed to be a two-pronged solution that would produce compressed natural gas from agricultural waste, such as crop stubble, cow manure, and press mud. Farmers were encouraged to send their crop residue to these plants rather than burning it in the hopes that it would reduce pollution and produce biogas and other byproducts.\n\n“The plant was established with the aim of tackling the stubble issue and also helping the environment. Today, Punjab is becoming a threat to the industrial sector. A total of Rs 70 crores was spent on establishing the plant. Although the plant is closed due to protests, we are still paying hefty EMIs and salaries to the employees. Not only this, three other plants in the region are halted, and we have been knocking on doors but nothing has been done by the state,” voiced operational head, CBG plant in Gunghrali village (Ludhiana), Pankaj Singh.\n\nAAP also opposed thermal power plants before taking a U-turn\n\nU-turns have become synonymous with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and another one in the series transpired in 2021 over the coal shortage situation that struck the national capital affecting power generation in the city. “For the last 3-4 days, the chief ministers across the country are flagging the issue to the central government. Amidst all this, the Union Power Minister is saying that there is no crisis at all. He said that Delhi Chief Minister should not have written a letter. Such an irresponsible approach of the centre is very unfortunate,” then Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged.\n\nA “complete blackout” in the national capital could result from the coal shortage, according to Satyendar Jain, if they do not obtain a supply of coal immediately. He asserted that the government of Delhi was prepared to purchase pricey electricity as well. Interestingly, AAP administration declared that coal-based power plants would no longer operate in Delhi in 2019. It took things a step further by outlawing the sectors that relied on coal for electricity. In 2020, the party alleged rampant violation of environmental norms by thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and demanded that they should be immediately shut down.\n\nIn a letter to former Union Minister RK Singh in 2020, then Power Minister Satyendra Jain urged him to close 11 thermal power plants that were located within 300 kilometers of Delhi. The Delhi government took a step forward three months later in June 2021 when it petitioned the Supreme Court for orders to shut down eleven coal-fired power facilities in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana.\n\n“AAP wants to know why CPCB is silent over the rampant violation of pollution norms by thermal power plants in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Despite the Supreme Court order and Central government’s direction, 13 coal-based thermal power plants in these states have not yet adopted anti-pollution technology,” stated then AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj. “When the Delhi government can shut down these power plants, then why can’t the other states do the same?” he asked, referring to the Delhi Badarpur Thermal Plant, which was shut down in 2018.\n\nAfter boasting about closing down thermal power facilities, the party of former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal started to blame the Modi administration for the electricity deficit after they probably realized that they had shot themselves in the foot and needed to shift the blame. In actuality, this is nothing new because the left liberal cabal and the political parties they support have long exploited the phrases “for the sake of the environment” and “protect the environment” to impede the nation’s progress.\n\nAAP’s cracker ban also failed to improve air quality in Delhi\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government decided to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and use of firecrackers in the nation’s capital in September in an attempt to “fight air pollution” during the approaching winter delivering a jolt to the industry and affecting millions of livelihoods. “There is a risk of increased air pollution in Delhi during the winter season. Burning firecrackers during this time further exacerbate pollution,” Environment Minister Gopal Rai declared in September.\n\nHe added, “In light of this situation, like last year, we are imposing a complete ban on the production, storage, sale, and use of all types of firecrackers, so that people can be protected from pollution. There will also be a complete ban on the online sale and delivery of any kind of firecrackers. To avoid any confusion, this ban applies to all types of firecrackers. The ban will remain in effect in Delhi until January 1, 2025, to provide relief to Delhiites from the pollution caused by burning firecrackers.”\n\nNotably, bursting crackers are only allowed to celebrate Arvind Kejriwal’s return from Tihar Jail. Nonetheless, the ban yielded no results as the air quality remained unchanged with the possibility of additional decline. The amount of work AAP put into cleaning up the Yamuna, which is still quite dirty and where people were compelled to observe the Chhath festival amid the poisonous foam is a clear indication of the party’s dedication to a clean environment.\n\nThe Delhi government was also slammed by the Supreme Court for not enacting a year-round ban on firecrackers to solve the ongoing air pollution problem in Delhi and for not enforcing the crackers ban strictly. It also examined the government’s order that makes exceptions for weddings and elections. The AAP appears to be more concerned with a day or two of Hindus bursting crackers than with taking proactive measures to address the real issue.\n\nWhy defend the indefensible\n\nThe opposition, the media, and their ecosystem are prepared to play politics and shift responsibility on anyone anyone instead of identifying the actual problem. They will happily point their fingers at Diwali (a Hindu festival because of their obvious aversion to all native things including its culture and religion), industries, power plants and maybe one day even aliens. There is no disputing that industries contribute to pollution, but at least they serve the purpose of fueling the country’s growth, but what does stubble-burning achieve besides causing pollution? Why defend it so shamelessly?\n\nWhat alternatives do these people have in the event that the thermal power plants are closed? How are they going to manage the electricity demand of over 33 million residents of Delhi NCR? Since cars also contribute to pollution, we ought to outlaw them as well? Do Ravish Kumar and those who promote such narratives don’t own cars or air conditioners?\n\nThe energy we use still majorly comes from fossil fuels combustion. Arvind Kejriwal’s opulent official residence is reported to have 50 air conditioners, a 250-tonne air conditioning plant, 12 large chandeliers and 57 ceiling fans. Given his concern for the environment and his opposition to power plants, he appears to have discovered another means to provide electricity in addition to a few environmentally friendly air conditioners.\n\nIndustrial expansion is essential to the nation’s economic development, and their first strategy focuses on ways to target the means that could accelerate India’s economic growth or attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration rather than attempting to find practical answers to the pressing issue. It only indicates that they are not bothered about the problem and only want to exploit the issue to get at their political opponents. Moreover, the ‘research’ studies that fail to consider all the factors and are not conducted on equal footing only serve to support their story, irrespective of their real objectives.\n\nTheir unreasonable propaganda against thermal power plants is reminiscent of the West, which has just realized the perils of climate change and wants India and other developing countries to control their carbon emissions after they flourished their economies not only through colonization, but also using coal.\n\nTo put it simply, concrete solutions that do not aim to hamper the country’s economic advancement, are not predicated on petty political maneuvers and absurd blame games that might be advantageous to the polity but definitely not the nation or its people must be devised to deal with the pollution problem. Thermal power plants and other elements that lead to pollution must be regulated, and steps should be taken to minimize their contribution to the problem. However, the issue calls for a comprehensive approach and effective methods. Only individuals with personal or political agendas can gain from blaming half of the reasons and ignoring the other half.",

		"text": "Donald Trump’s victory in recent US elections has pushed the left-liberals across the world into delirium. The left-liberal media is finding it hard to fathom that despite their well-oiled propaganda machinery at work, the Americans handed a historic triumph to the Donald. On Wednesday, the 13th of November, UK-based left-wing media outlet The Guardian announced that it would stop posting on social media site X (formerly Twitter). The Guardian further blamed X’s new owner and Trump supporter Elon Musk for the leftist propaganda outlet’s departure from the popular social media platform.\n\nThe leftist propaganda outlet claimed that after the change of ownership, the micro-blogging site now promotes or distributes disturbing content, “including far-right conspiracy theories and racism”. The statement stated, “The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.”\n\nThe Guardian archived its X posts on 13th November 2024\n\nContrary to the expectations The Guardian must have had, the X users expressed their joy over The Guardian’s decision to quit posting on X with many calling it a “good riddance”. Some X users also pointed out that The Guardian fears that X’s Community Notes would not let the British publication peddle its lies and propaganda unchecked.\n\nOne X user said, “Scared of getting called out for your propaganda and lies? The news happens on X. Which means you are no longer the media.”\n\nScared of getting called out for your propaganda and lies?\n\n\n\nThe news happens on X.\n\n\n\nWhich means you are no longer the media. — Thomas Musket ⓒ (@ThomasMusket) November 13, 2024\n\nAnother one said: “In other words, we are leaving X because we cannot get away with lying to the public on this platform.”\n\nIn other words, we are leaving X because we cannot get away with lying to the public on this platform. — Vince Langman (@LangmanVince) November 13, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Spectator columnist Samantha Smith said, “You might be able to disable comments and refuse feedback on your website. But on X, all journalism is subject to scrutiny and disapproval. You simply hate that people they disagree with are allowed to exist and have a voice here. So, you’re jumping ship. What poor journalism.”\n\nYou might be able to disable comments and refuse feedback on your website.\n\n\n\nBut on X, all journalism is subject to scrutiny and disapproval.

This could possibly be true, given The Guardian’s dwindling readership”, he said.\n\n“Left-wing newspaper The Guardian has announced it is rage quitting X because of Donald Trump and @elonmusk. But it appears to be a cynical stunt to direct people to download its app and to donate to its anti-Donald Trump campaign. Blinded by its left-wing bias, the paper has published a number of fake news articles over the years, such as when it published lies by reporters @loisbeckett @SamTLevin claiming the Wi Spa trans indecent exposure incident was a hoax by women,” Ngo said adding that while The Guardian called the Wi Spa trans indecent exposure incident a ‘hoax’, charges were filed against a serial sex offender in this case by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nLeft-wing newspaper The Guardian has announced it is rage quitting X because of Donald Trump and @elonmusk.

An X user called out the “hard-hitting” journalism of The Guardian and attached screengrabs of some of the ‘gems’ of the leftist propaganda outlet wherein its columnists peddled hatred and furthered their leftist-woke agenda.\n\nMake sure to download the Guardian app for hard hitting journalism like this! pic.twitter.com/IVfbciT1su — Evan Riggs (@EvanRiggss) November 13, 2024\n\nIs The Guardian quitting X due to ‘toxicity’ and ‘racism’ or because it can no longer shape and control political narratives?\n\nThe Guardian’s decision to stop posting on X under the pretext of it becoming a ‘toxic’ platform is ironic given the propaganda publication’s one-sided advocacy and its own political-ideological bias. The leftist propaganda outlet’s contention that X is now a battleground for toxic discourse, manipulated by its owner Elon Musk, is conveniently skewed.\n\nWhat The Guardian fails to admit is that its resentment stems not from the platform’s supposed toxicity, but from the fact that it no longer has control over the political narratives it finds palatable. It is unfathomable for The Guardian and other leftist propagandist legacy media that the era where they used to set the narratives with the people hardly having any say or questioning and critiquing them is gone.\n\nThe Guardian says that “X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.” However, it has no qualms about being absolutely biased and using its reach to shape pro-left-liberal opinions. Media is supposed to be unbiased, however, The Guardian has its own standards of bias.\n\nWhen Elon Musk allows people from all walks of life with their own differing ideologies and views to express themselves on X, he is influencing political discourse, but The Guardian serving as a Democrat’s stooge is brave and fair journalism and suffers a massive meltdown when Kamala Harris loses.\n\nFor many years, The Guardian not only used but also thrived on platforms like X, where conversations were heavily regulated to fall in line with the leftist narrative and right-wing voices were muzzled. However, after Elon Musk bought X, the platform has witnessed a significant shift towards a more free discourse, allowing a broader spectrum of perspectives to have a say without being scrutinised. Perhaps, this is the main cause of The Guardian’s chagrin: It can no longer dominate the discourse particularly during the election cycle.\n\nClearly, The Guardian is throwing tantrums since it can no longer use X to push its leftist agenda and escape criticism as it used to in the pre-Musk Twitter era. Contrary to its holier-than-thou assertion that it cannot tolerate racism and ‘toxicity’ rampant on X, it is simply dejected by the fact that X has in a short time emerged as an alternative to the inherently biased legacy media and people are no longer blindly consuming the propaganda mainstream media offers them under the garb of news.\n\nWhat’s even more amusing is that like any other average left-liberal propaganda outlet, The Guardian also positions itself as a ‘defender’ of freedom of speech, and claims to be fighting against the ‘authoritarians’ who have no regard for press freedom, but cries hoarse when those of the opposing view exercise the their freedom of speech. It is quick to label anything out of its ideological bubble as ‘toxic’, ‘fascist’, ‘racist’ and whatnot but passes off its own leftist and woke agenda as ‘open’ and ‘independent’ journalism.\n\nLiberals across the world share this trait, they talk about democratic values and press freedom, liberty and what not but only till they control the things, they reveal their true ‘fascist’ character in the face of slight deviance by anyone from their established and control ‘system’.\n\nOpIndia reported earlier, how the traditional Democrat propaganda factory The Washington Post received flak from liberals after its owner Jeff Bezos announced that the publication will not endorse any candidate ahead of the 2024 presidential elections in the US. Now, The Guardian’s hissy fit reveals that left-liberals are not actually interested in open discourse allowing diverse, opposing and critical voices to exist and are actual fascists who only loves to brag about it when they control the discourse. Probably, that is why when the The Guardian saw it can no longer push its mendacious narratives with Trump returning to power and Musk transforming the leftist eco-chamber Twitter into a truly unbiased platform X, it decided to pack and leave while throwing allegations of ‘toxicity’ on its way out.",

		"title": "Halal meat won't be forced upon non-Muslims on Air India flights",
		"text": "In an important, yet overdue, move towards respecting religious diversity, Air India has decided not to serve Halal meat to non-Muslim passengers. The Halal meals, labelled as ‘Moslem Meal,’ are now available as a dietary preference and will be served only to customers who have opted for them.\n\nOther options on the flight include diabetic meal, gluten-free meal, non-vegetarian meal, vegan meal, Jain meal, Kosher meal, Hindu meal, and more.\n\nThe step taken by Air India is a welcome move as it respects religious diversity without imposing particular dietary practices upon unwilling participants. Previously, in Air India flights and, in fact, in most flights, restaurants, and food chains, Halal meat was the default choice, as Hindus and Sikhs often did not enquire about how the meat was prepared. In contrast, Muslims are particular about their dietary choices and prefer not to eat in places where Halal meat is not served.\n\nUpon realising how Halal meat has dominated dietary options and is being imposed on Hindus, Sikhs, and other non-Muslim communities, voices have been raised against the practice. Air India has become one of the first service providers to respect the dietary choices of not only Muslims but all communities.\n\nIndia is a pluralistic society. It is crucial that religious choices, especially those concerning food, remain precisely that—a choice. The menu now available on Air India’s website has distinct options catering to different communities based on religion and food preferences, such as Jain meal or Hindu meal, as well as vegan meal or fruit meal. The menu seeks to accommodate the cultural and religious dietary preferences of every passenger, which is a welcome move.\n\nHowever, the core issue remains the implicit expectation that all non-vegetarian food served must be Halal-certified, thus catering exclusively to Islamic dietary laws. The choice provided by Air India should not be limited to Air India but should be extended to all places that serve food. The approach of serving only Halal-certified meat is inherently unfair to Hindus, Sikhs, and other non-Muslim communities who may object to consuming food prepared according to Islamic rules.\n\nUnderstanding Halal and its religious context\n\nFor those who are unaware, Halal, which literally translates to “permissible” in Arabic, refers to food prepared following specific Islamic guidelines. The process of Halal certification includes slaughter practices with distinct religious elements. It primarily involves invoking Allah’s name and a specific method of killing the animal.\n\nHalal is not just a label; it is a religious practice embedded within Islam. For many Hindus and Sikhs, consuming Halal meat is objectionable. Unlike Halal, Hindu dietary requirements do not impose such prescriptive religious rites upon their food sources. Thus, the compulsion to eat Halal meat can be considered particularly insensitive towards non-Muslim communities.\n\nRespecting diverse religious practices\n\nAir India now offers a wide selection of meal types, demonstrating the airline’s commitment to serving India’s diverse passengers. However, it is notable that only Halal and Kosher meals are prepared in kosher-certified and Halal-certified kitchens. The rest of the meals do not undergo such separations in the kitchen. The next step should be to ensure division at kitchen counters where vegetarian, vegan, and non-vegetarian foods are prepared separately, respecting dietary and religious preferences. After all, just as Muslims are entitled to Halal options, Hindus, Sikhs, and others deserve the freedom to eat in a manner that aligns with their beliefs. It is not just about the labels but about respecting everyone’s choice and faith.\n\nReasserting the rights of the majority\n\nIn a secular democracy, the rights of religious minorities are essential. However, this does not mean that the rights of the majority can be overlooked. Hindus have long resisted Halal offerings on religious and cultural grounds. Yet, Halal food has increasingly been normalised without sufficient discussion on its appropriateness with all stakeholders. The silent imposition of Halal on a broader population has resulted in alienating Hindus and Sikhs and disregarding their right to non-Halal food. In a pluralistic society like India, freedom of choice should be available for all communities, regardless of their population size.\n\nThe Halal economy and its hidden dangers\n\nThe growing “Halal economy” extends far beyond individual dietary choices, involving an entire ecosystem driven by Islamic certification standards. The Halal economy’s expansion impacts industries ranging from food and finance to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, where Halal-certified products are increasingly favoured or required.\n\nThis certification process often provides funds to Islamic organisations and businesses, potentially creating an exclusive economic circuit that disadvantages non-Halal producers. Moreover, in countries like India, where the majority population is non-Muslim, the unchecked growth of the Halal economy risks sidelining local businesses that do not or cannot comply with Halal requirements, inadvertently enforcing a religious mandate on diverse populations.\n\nFurthermore, there is evidence that some organisations providing Halal certifications have links to terrorist outfits, raising the possibility that funds collected through certification may be diverted to such organisations.\n\nThe way forward – True choice in food\n\nA sensible solution to the Halal economy is simple: ensure the availability of non-Halal meat options alongside Halal options in all public food services. All establishments that serve food must offer non-Halal options so that the dietary preferences of all customers are respected. Dietary preferences are, after all, a choice. They should be defined and implemented as a choice, not as a forced preference. The availability of diverse meals on Air India demonstrates the possibility of respectful accommodation.\n\nThe debate over Halal in India reflects a growing awareness that non-Muslims should not be compelled to follow Islamic dietary rules. Air India’s move is a beginning. But the real issue of the silent imposition of Halal on everyone still persists in India’s food sector. A truly inclusive approach would ensure both Halal and non-Halal choices are available, with non-Halal as the default and Halal as an option, allowing passengers to eat according to their beliefs without imposition from religious practices that are not their own.\n\nIndia prides itself on religious diversity. In such a country, respecting the dietary customs of all religions should be non-negotiable. Businesses that serve food cannot cater exclusively to the dietary choices of Muslims while ignoring those of non-Muslims. Air India’s initiative should spark broader changes across all public institutions, from airlines to schools, hospitals, and even workplaces. Only then will we have a society where individual rights are fully respected, and freedom of choice is genuinely upheld.",

		"text": "On 15th November, Gurdwara Shri Dashmesh Darbar in Thane issued a statement refuting claims made by Congress leaders and certain media outlets that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President JP Nadda and other party leaders were removed from the Gurdwara premises for wearing stoles with the party symbol. The statement was shared by the President of the Gurdwara Committee, Gurmukh Singh Syan.\n\nSource: Gurmukh Singh Syan/Facebook\n\nIn the statement, Syan said, “BJP President Hon. Shri JP Nadda ji visited our Gurdwara Shri Dashmesh Darbar in Thane today on the auspicious occasion of the 555th Prakash Parv of Baba Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji to pay his respects to Guru Granth Sahib Ji and meet the Sangat. Shri JP Nadda ji offered his respects to Guru Granth Sahib Ji and the Sangat with great devotion and emotion, and also listened to the kirtan for five minutes.\n\nAfter the darshan, the Gurdwara committee requested him to stay for five more minutes for a felicitation, as the kirtan, which had started during the darshan, was about to conclude. However, Shri JP Nadda ji humbly said, ‘I am just a regular devotee, I do not expect any felicitation, and please do not stop the kirtan for my sake. I also have to attend the next scheduled programme.’ With great reverence, he bowed respectfully to Guru Granth Sahib Ji and the kirtaniyas, folded his hands, and proceeded to leave.\n\nAt that moment, a few media persons entered the area and began recording videos with their cameras, standing with their backs to the ongoing kirtan. The media persons were politely requested not to stand with their backs to the kirtan and were asked to maintain decorum. Despite this, some journalists began spreading rumours about the incident.\n\nWe wish to clarify to all devotees that Hon. Shri JP Nadda ji paid his respects with full devotion, maintaining the sanctity of the Gurdwara. We strongly refute the incorrect reports being circulated regarding this matter.“\n\nCongress’s Supriya Shrinate shared fake news\n\nThe clarification from Syan came after media outlets and some Congress leaders shared fake news that JP Nadda and other party leaders were removed from the Gurdwara premises. In a post on X, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said, “BJP President Nadda reached Thane in Maharashtra today on the occasion of Guru Purab to campaign for the elections on the pretext of paying obeisance at the Gurdwara. The congregation threw out everyone, including Nadda, who was wearing a towel with the BJP election symbol. Everyone is equal in the Gurdwara; feelings should be respected.” She also shared a trimmed video of the incident to create a narrative that BJP leaders were asked to leave.\n\nBJP अध्यक्ष नड्डा महाराष्ट्र के थाणे में आज गुरु पूरब के दिन गुरुद्वारा में मत्था टेकने के बहाने चुनाव प्रचार करने पहुँचे\n\n\n\nसंगत ने नड्डा समेत BJP चुनाव चिह्न के गमछे पहने हुए सबको बाहर कर दिया\n\n\n\nगुरुद्वारे में सब एक समान, भावनाओं की इज़्ज़त करनी चाहिए\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/oYDl6qZ3HM — Supriya Shrinate (@SupriyaShrinate) November 15, 2024\n\nMedia outlet Hindustan also shared a similar report. According to the report, on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, BJP President JP Nadda visited the Gurdwara in Thane, Maharashtra, accompanied by several party leaders. Their arrival, along with a large entourage, reportedly disrupted the ongoing kirtan (devotional singing), leading to the sevadars (volunteers) expressing their displeasure. Following this, Nadda and his associates were allegedly asked to leave the Gurdwara.",

		"title": "5 booked in Maharashtra for 'targeting' MVA's Mira Bhayandar candidate Muzaffar Hussain, complaint terms mercy petition signed by him for Yakub Memon as 'fake'",
		"text": "The state assembly elections in Maharashtra are right around the corner. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA )alliance led by the Congress, and the Mahayuti alliance led by the BJP are engaged in a tough fight with each other. While MVA is allegedly making efforts to garner the support of the minority community, while the Mahayuti, and its supporters are exposing the MVA candidates for extending support to terrorists.\n\nOne such letter of an MVA candidate went viral over the internet on 5th November, exposing Congress candidate from Mira Bhayandar seat of Mumbai, Syed Muzaffar Hussain. The letter was a mercy petition for terrorist Yakub Memon, dated 28th July 2015, and was signed by Muzaffar Hussain along with ex-Minister Arif Naseem Khan, Amin Patel, Aslam Sheikh, Sheik Asif Sheikh Rashid, Husnabano Khulife, Yusuf Abrahani, and Javed Juneja.\n\nHe is not a local Congress leader, he is working president of Maharashtra Congress, Muzaffar Hussain.\n\n\n\nHe had signed Mercy Petition request of Terrorist Yakub Memon.\n\n\n\nHe is contesting from Mira-Bhayandar seat of Thane district. https://t.co/h42kClU2FM pic.twitter.com/cwRspUtSCw — Facts (@BefittingFacts) November 4, 2024\n\n“We wish to appeal to Your Excellency for clemency towards the conviction of Yakub Memon”, the letter said. Several eminent personalities like filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, Actor Naseeruddin Shah, Activist Tushar Gandhi, CPI’s Sitaram Yechury, BJP’s Shatrughan Sinha, Lawyer Vrinda Grover, and 290 others had signed the mercy petition for Memon.\n\n“We request Your Excellency to grant clemency under article 72 of the Indian Constitution and commute his death sentence into life imprisonment,” the letter read. Notably, Memon played a crucial role in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts.\n\nThe letter made rounds on social media last week with a host of social media accounts alleging Hussain’s backing to the terrorist. Notably, a defamation complaint against all such social media handles has been filed at Mira Road police station claiming that the letter was ‘fake’ and that it was being deliberately spread on social media to influence votes against Hussain ahead of the elections, scheduled on 20th November.\n\nOpIndia has obtained the FIR copy that has been filed against individuals identified as Befitting Facts (X Page), Aamchi Mumbai (Instagram), Kunal Shukla, Jerome Dsouza, and Ganesh Murugan. In the complaint, the complainant identified as Rahul Dinesh Roy claimed that these individuals posted ‘fake messages and fabricated documents’ linking Hussain to terror outfits.\n\n“The messages are apparently aimed at instigating the sentiments of people belonging to a particular religion, through distorted and negative campaigning. ‘Voting for Congress means voting for love jihad, aiming for a Muslim -supporting CM’, these kinds of messages with Hussian’s photo and the claimed letter were being spread on social media. This is an attempt to create communal disharmony,” the complaint added.\n\nNotably, the complaint terms the mercy petition for terrorist Yakub Menon, signed by Muzaffar Hussain as ‘fake’. However, several media reports from the year 2015 mention the fact that the mercy petition was furthered by 6 Congress legislators, a former MLA, and a corporator appealing for clemency for the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blast convict.\n\nYakub Memon was convicted for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts and was sentenced to death. In 2015, the death sentence was carried out after his mercy petition was rejected. In a media report by Indian Express dated 29th July, 2015, it is clearly mentioned that Hussain (then MLC) was the signatory to the letter that urged the then President to look into Article 72 of the Indian Constitution and commute Memon’s death sentence.\n\nScreengrab from Indian Express article from 2015\n\nThe Congress leaders apparently signed the petition after AIMIM chief Owaisi claimed that Memon was being convicted for belonging to the specific community. Apart from Indian Express, Umid media channel also reported that Hussain had signed the letter seeking clemency of terrorist Yakub Memon.\n\nScreengrab from Umid media article from 2015\n\nFurther, local media reports like the Maharashtranama and Loksatta also reported in the year 2015 that the letter was signed by Congress leaders including Muzzafar Hussain. Not only this, but the letter was also embedded by these media houses clearly showing Hussain as a signatory.\n\nscreengrab from Maharashtranama report from 2015.\n\nThe FIR filed by Roy at present blatantly claims that the letter released with the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha emblem on it, seeking clemency of terrorist Yakub Memon is fake, and that it is deliberately being spread amid the ongoing state assembly elections to create communal disharmony. However, the letter was actually issued by the Congress leaders in the year 2015 as reported by several media houses.\n\nSeveral prominent social media users are meanwhile slamming MVA leader Muzaffar Hussain for denying the fact that he had signed the letter in support of the terrorist through this FIR, which has been filed by Adv Roy. “The working president of Maharashtra Congress wasn’t ashamed to sign a mercy petition but offended to see people exposing him?” said one of the users.\n\nThe working president of Maharashtra Congress wasn't ashamed to sign a mercy petition but offended to see people exposing him? https://t.co/Om2GjiMyRe — Mr Sinha (@MrSinha_) November 8, 2024\n\nAnother user stated that several media reports, 9 years ago, had posted about the incident and that now the same will be proved in the courts. “So many news media reporting him as a signed petitioner & he is denying it..! Better he takes back those complaints, once proved in courts it will be breaking news all over the SM & news media,” the user said.\n\nPersons ‘falsely’ accused by Roy say a reply will be given post-election\n\nMeanwhile, Befitting Facts, one of the persons accused of posting the letter on X on 5th November commented on the FIR against him and said, “Hussain has suddenly become secular and visiting temples for votes. So he is trying to suppress his past and trying to intimidate social media users. But he forgot that he is getting into a trap by filing a complaint. Now the court will say that YES MUZAFFAR HAD SIGNED MERCY PETITION OF YAKUB MEMON.”\n\nThe other persons accused in the FIR are Amchi Mumbai’s Instagram channel and individuals Kunal Shukla, Jerome Dsouza, and Ganesh Murugan who as per the complaint, used WhatsApp to spread the letter.\n\nOpIndia exclusively talked to Jerome D’souza to learn that “around 5 persons have been falsely accused in a case that has been filed by Advocate Roy who works for Muzaffar Hussain.”\n\n“We had just shared the letter showing Hussain as a signatory on one of our WhatsApp groups. The letter is already in the public domain and it is strange that Hussain and Roy are terming the said petition as fake. We all have been falsely accused in the case. However, a reply to this notice will be issued by us post-elections,” D’souza said.\n\nHe also added that he is in contact with the other two accused persons named Kunal Shukla and Ganesh Murugan he has no idea who runs Befitting Facts (X channel) and Amchi Mumbai (Instagram profile). He further expressed surprise at the Mira Road police claiming how did they not see that the letter was already in the public domain before filing an FIR against the 5.\n\nThe complaint in the given case has been filed under sections 299 (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 302 (intentionally hurting someone’s religious feelings) of the Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita and section 125 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 for promoting enmity between classes in connection with the elections.\n\nMuzzafar Hussain declared INC candidate from Mira Bhayandar\n\nOn 24th October, the former legislator Muzaffar Hussain was declared as the candidate from Mira Bhayandar by the Congress party. Hussain’s name appeared in the first list of 48 candidates announced by the Congress party, alongside prominent senior leaders like Nana Patole, Prithviraj Chavan, Vijay Wadettiwar, and Balasaheb Thorat.\n\nMuzaffar Hussain began his political journey as a Youth Congress worker. He was first elected to the Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation in 1991 and later served as the State Youth Congress president for an extended period. He is also a builder by profession. In 2004, he was elected to the Legislative Council, where he served until 2009, and has since sought re-nomination to the council. Hussain faced a significant political setback in 2009 when his stronghold, the Mira Bhayandar Assembly constituency, was allocated to the NCP as part of a seat-sharing arrangement, preventing him from contesting the assembly election. Later that year, he ran in a by-election for the Bhiwandi seat vacated by SP leader Abu Azmi but was defeated by a Shiv Sena (then united) candidate.\n\nA dedicated Congress loyalist, Hussain, during the election campaign, visited a temple in the Mira Bhayandar region during Diwali, and said that he wanted to break the barriers between the different communities. During Ramadan this year, he was also the managing trustee of the Jama Masjid Al Shams Mosque, and had extended an invitation to visit the mosque to worshippers of all faiths and castes.\n\nIn the 2019 assembly elections, Hussain contested unsuccessfully, losing to independent candidate Geeta Jain, who garnered 79,575 votes and defeated her BJP opponent Narendra Mehta by a margin of 15,526 votes. Hussain received 55,939 votes, capturing nearly 27% of the total vote share.\n\nHowever, sources on the ground indicate that while Hussain holds a ‘secularist’ image, he has assiduously cultivated his vote bank, 90% of which is composed of the Muslim population.\n\nThe 288 legislative assembly seats in Maharashtra will go to the polls in a single phase on November 20 while the counting of votes will take place on November 23.",

		"title": "Kaushik Raj, named in court for helping Umar Khalid skew the narrative, does it again: How Islamists are lying about the withdrawl of bail plea by the Delhi riot accused",
		"text": "“Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth”. The Islamists and liberals seem to have been deeply influenced by this saying by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The Islamo-leftist ecosystem has been blatantly lying about the deferrals on the bail pleas moved by 2020 anti-Hindu Delhi Riots accused Umar Khalid since his arrest in September 2020.\n\nIn this vein, ‘Journalist’ and leftist propagandist Kaushik Raj claimed that somehow Umar Khalid was forced to withdraw his bail plea from the Supreme Court after 14 deferrals. He insinuated that even as CJI Chandrachud said that he granted bail to senior journalist Arnab Goswami to AltNews ‘fact-checker’ Mohammed Zubair, somehow Umar Khalid was deliberately denied bail.\n\n“While CJI Chandrachud claims he gave bails from A to Z, from Arnab to Zubair, Umar Khalid had to withdraw his bail plea from the Supreme Court after 14 deferrals. This should be a shame for the Supreme Court,” Raj said in an X post on 5th November.\n\nBefore delving into how Kaushik Raj’s claim is just another thread in the mendacious narrative, the Islamo-liberal ecosystem is weaving to project Umar Khalid as a victim of somehow a ‘biased’ and ‘incompetent’ judiciary, it is pertinent to find out Kaushik Raj’s connection with the 2020 anti-Hindu Delhi Riots.\n\nDuring the bail hearing of Umar Khalid in Karkardooma Court in April this year, the public prosecutor said a false narrative is being set in media and on social media to influence the judiciary by media houses, activists and NGOs to influence the judiciary in favour of Khalid. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad revealed WhatsApp chats between Umar Khalid and several influential individuals like Swara Bhaskar, Sushant Singh, AltNews, Yogendra Yadav, Sanjukta Basu, Pooka Bhatt and others to demonstrate how he was creating a false narrative in his favour to influence the judiciary in his favour. The prosecutor took several names like Teesta Setalvad, Aakar Patel, Amnesty International, Azhar Khan, Kaushik Raj and Swati Chaturvedi who have been helping in setting the narrative. The prosecutor further mentioned that these individuals and entities run hashtags in his support and present a false narrative of the case.\n\nThe truth of 14 adjournments ‘injustice’\n\nWhile the leftists claim that Umar Khalid’s bail hearing is being deliberately delayed and that he is languishing in jail for four years because the entire ‘system’ including the Judiciary and the Modi government is letting Khalid get bail, however, Umar Khalid himself is to blame for 7 out of 14 adjournments.\n\nIt was only in April 2023 that he approached the Supreme Court. Before that, Umar Khalid had got a 1-week reprieve to attend his sister’s marriage in December 2022. If Kaushik Raj and other ‘liberals’ are so concerned about Umar Khalid rotting in jail without trial, they should ask why Umar Khalid waited 6 months before moving to the Supreme Court for bail, after the rejection by the High Court. Also, while there were screeches about the delay in the hearing, there were several times when his lawyer Kapil Sibal himself wanted the case to be adjourned.\n\nNotably, OpIndia found that out of the 14 adjournments in 2023 and 2024, 7 delays and adjournments were sought by Umar Khalid himself. It therefore becomes evident that the withdrawal was certainly not because of the famed “delay” in hearing. While the Islamo-leftist ecosystem continues to cry ‘injustice’, it is the alleged failed forum shopping attempts of the accused’s lawyer that has Khalid rotting in jail for so long.\n\nIt was on the 31st of October when a Supreme Court bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Bela Trivedi tagged Khalid’s bail petition with other matters challenging the constitutionality of provisions in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The petitions include Khalid’s writ petition challenging the UAPA provisions, and the UAPA Charges Related to Tripura Violence where FIRs were filed against lawyers and journalists who undertook a fact-finding mission in the Tripura violence of October 2021. It is also on the 31st of October that the saga of adjournments by Kapil Sibal was triggered.\n\nOn the 29th of November, the petitioners wanted the petitions de-tagged. Prashant Bhushan said that the Tripura violence case had been heard by CJI Chandrachud 8 times and therefore, this case should be heard by him as well. Justice Bela Trivedi disagreed and said that the petitions would be heard by her and the newly appointed Justice S.C. Sharma. This exchange was even though the petitions had been tagged due to Umar Khalid’s lawyers’ request to begin with.\n\nIn this instance, it was due to the unavailability of Kapil Sibal and the ASG that the hearing was pushed to January 2024.\n\nInterestingly, in December, Prashant Bhushan had shot off an angry letter to CJI Chandrachud over the Tripura matter, with which Umar Khalid’s plea was tagged, being listed in front of Justice Bela Trivedi instead of the CJI himself. There were other letters too complaining of irregularities in cases being listed in front of Justice Trivedi – by Dushyant Dave and Abhishek Manu Singhvi.\n\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi at the time, in a hearing related to Satyendra Jain’s bail petition mentioned the ‘irregularity’ in the case being listed in front of Justice Trivedi, which the CJI promptly shut down.\n\nThe CJI responded to an urgent oral mention made by former Delhi Minister Satyender Jain’s lawyer, represented by senior advocate A.M. Singhvi about the listing of his bail petition in the Delhi liquor policy case before a Bench headed by Justice Bela M. Trivedi on December 14. Singhvi said a Special Bench of Justices A.S. Bopanna and Trivedi was already hearing the case. “We have been arguing before the Special Bench. The case is already partially heard… Now, today, it has been listed before a Bench headed by Justice Trivedi. Let it continue to be heard by the earlier Special Bench,” Singhvi urged.\n\nPost-lunch, when the court re-convened, the Chief Justice informed Singhvi that there had been a communication from the office of Justice Bopanna that he could not resume his judicial duties after the Diwali vacations due to medical reasons. The judge’s office had asked all the part-heard matters before him to be released. Consequently, the case of Jain was shifted to the judge, Justice Trivedi, on the Bench.\n\n“It is very easy to fling allegations and letters,” the Chief Justice said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was present in the courtroom, said the “only way to deal with malicious letters is by ignoring them”.\n\nThe CJI had said, “If the case is listed before a judge, the judge will take a call. I will not say anything,” the Chief Justice said emphatically. This was in response to not just the issue raised by Singhvi, but also Prashant Bhushan (In the Tripura case to which Umar Khalid’s bail plea was tagged) and Dushyant Dave.\n\nThereafter, the hearings came up in front of the bench comprising Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Pankaj Mithal. This time, while the unavailability of ASG promoted the bench to postpone the hearing to 17th January, Kapil Sibal asked the court to delay it further—the hearing was set for 24 January 2024 instead.\n\nOn the 24th, the case was listed before a Bench of Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Ujjal Bhuyan. It was again the advocate of Umar Khalid who asked for an adjournment, which was granted.\n\nOn the 31st of January, a bench of Justices Bela Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal were to hear the plea. However, due to Justice Mithal’s unavailability, the newly appointed Justice P.B. Varale joined Justice Trivedi instead. While the court wanted to hear the case on the 1st of February, it was against Kapil Sibal who sought the case to be listed on another day since he would be busy with the AMU matter. To this, the judges had kept it open-ended, saying “We will see”.\n\nWhen the case came up for hearing on the 1st of February, as requested by Kapil Sibal – the bench adjourned the hearing to the 7th of February, however, on the 7th, the bench was occupied in another case. When the hearing came up on the 14th of February, Kapil Sibal withdrew the bail petition and the separate petition challenging the validity of certain sections of the UAPA.\n\nAs per the timeline traced by OpIndia, it is evident that after the exit of Justice Aniruddha Bose, Umar Khalid and his lawyers – Kapil Sibal to be precise – demanded adjournments ad nauseam till the petitions were withdrawn. Further, it is evident that Prashant Bhushan also attempted to ensure that the case was listed before the CJI, a proposal struck down by Justice Bela Trivedi. This poses an important question of whether Kapil Sibal was “trying his luck” at forum shopping and having failed at that, withdrew his petition from the Supreme Court. OpIndia’s analysis of the sequence of events in the Umar Khalid case suggests that there were only two “changes in circumstances” that could have led to the decision by Umar Khalid – one is the change in judge, the other is a crucial change/clarification of the law On the 7th of January 2024, in a different matter, the Supreme Court clarified that in UAPA cases, jail is the norm and bail is the exception – Umar Khalid and other accused have been arguing in court that according to the law, jail is the exception and bail is the norm as on the 7th of January 2024, in a different matter, the Supreme Court clarified that in UAPA cases, jail is the norm and bail is the exception – Umar Khalid and other accused have been arguing in court that according to the law, jail is the exception and bail is the norm.",

		"text": "On 3rd November, Chennai Police arrested Mohammed Nishad and his wife Nasia for the murder of their 15-year-old maid. Reportedly, before killing the minor maid, she was subjected to severe torture including branding with cigarettes and a hot iron pan. The dead body of the maid was recovered from the bathroom of the couple’s house. While the couple involved in the murder of the minor is a Muslim, media houses including Times of India and Hindustan Times connected the murder of the minor maid to the Hindu festival Diwali.\n\nMedia gave a ‘Diwali’ twist to the murder\n\nThough the accused in the case are Muslims, media houses including Times of India and Hindustan Times gave it a “Diwali” twist. The Times of India prominently used the word “Diwali” in its social media post about the incident, omitting the names of the accused. The post read, “A 15-year-old domestic help died on #Diwali after being brutally assaulted by her employers. The couple inflicted severe injuries, including cigarette burns, and locked her in a washroom to die.”\n\nSource: X\n\nThe names of the accused appear only in the second or third paragraphs after opening the report. [Archived link of the news report]\n\nSource: TOI\n\nSimilarly, Hindustan Times did not mention the names of the accused in the initial paragraphs of the report on murder of the maid but noted that the incident occurred on Diwali. In the HT report, a separate section was created where the names of the accused were mentioned. [Archived link of the news report]\n\nSource: Hindustan Times\n\nDetails of the incident\n\nThe incident took place in Mehta Nagar which comes under the Aminjikarai police station area in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. As per reports, Mohammed Nishad and his wife Nasia had employed a 15-year-old minor as a maid. She was brought to Nishad’s house by a brother-sister duo for domestic work. The girl was originally from Tanjavur. She was doing domestic work to support her widowed mother one and a half years ago.\n\nMedia reports suggest that 35-year-old Nishad and his 30-year-old wife had been torturing the minor girl for several days. She was often beaten by the husband-wife duo. She was also burnt multiple times with cigarettes and a hot iron pan. Marks on the victim’s neck indicated strangulation. Both were recovered by the police on 31st October from the bathroom of the couple’s flat.\n\nPolice said in a statement that she was brutally beaten on the day of her death. Following the brutal beating, she went to the bathroom where she succumbed to her injuries. Following her death, Nishad and his wife locked the house and fled to hide at a friend’s place. The police were informed about the death by the lawyer of the accused. The police rushed to the accused’s house and recovered the body.\n\nThe body was then sent to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital for a postmortem examination. Once the report was received, the incidents of torture and death came to the fore. The police arrested the couple and detained four others for questioning including the brother-sister duo who arranged the victim’s employment and the couple where Nishad and his wife were hiding.\n\nA case has been registered under various Sections of Bharatiya Nayay Sanhita (BNS) and POCSO Act.",

		"text": "Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia has announced that it will no longer publish tweets directly on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, and will suspend its accounts.\n\nIn a statement on its official website on Thursday, the Spanish newspaper said, “La Vanguardia will stop publishing tweets directly on social network X and will suspend its accounts. This social network has become a platform for conspiracy theories and misinformation, ideas that have a way of multiplying their reach in what was once Twitter, which they would not have if it had effective and reasonable moderation.”\n\n“This newspaper notes that ideas that violate human rights, such as hatred of ethnic minorities, misogyny and racism, are part of the viral content distributed on X, where they become viral and capture more user time in order to earn more money from advertising inserts,” the statement added.\n\nIn addition to the decision to stop publishing on X, this newspaper said that it will continue to monitor people, entities, companies and institutions on this network to promptly inform its readers of messages and debates that may occur on it.\n\nNotably, the newspaper said that its decision comes as Donald Trump announced he would name Elon Musk and former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aimed at cutting back on US government spending.\n\nThe decision by the Spanish newspaper comes after British news publisher The Guardian on Wednesday said that it is quitting the X, citing billionaire owner Elon Musk’s influence during the US presidential election process. The Guardian in a statement said that the publication said it will no longer post from any official Guardian accounts on the site. Further, it said that the recent US election underlined its view that X is a “toxic” platform and that Musk uses it to influence politics.\n\nLast year, the US media organisation National Public Radio [NPR], stopped posting on X after the social media platform labelled it as “state-affiliated media.”\n\nPBS, a US public TV broadcaster, also suspended its posts for the same reason.\n\nMeanwhile, after the 2024 United States Presidential election that confirmed Trump’s victory, social media platform X witnessed its largest user exodus since Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, with users migrating to alternatives like Bluesky, CNN reported.\n\nMore than 1,15,000 US users deactivated their X accounts the day after the election, and this figure only includes those who deactivated through the website, excluding mobile app users, CNN reported citing a report from digital intelligence platform Similarweb.\n\nThis shift follows Musk’s influential role in the US presidential election. Bluesky’s user base has doubled in 90 days, reaching 15 million after gaining 1 million new sign-ups in a single week.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

		"title": "Journalist Shubhankar Mishra reveals his editor had asked him to run propaganda against PM Modi in 2019 Surat coaching fire tragedy",
		"text": "In a podcast released on 10th November, featuring actor Vikrant Massey, journalist Shubhankar Mishra spoke about how the mainstream media spins narratives around an incident which influences perception about the incident or people involved. Mishra revealed that back in 2019, the television news channel where he worked as a reporter then had asked him to visit the house of one of the victims of the Surat coaching fire accident which claimed 22 lives and get a bite from them blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the incident.\n\nThe fire accident at the coaching centre in a commercial complex in Surat’s Jakatnaka area transpired on 24th May 2019. The fire broke due to a short circuit in the air conditioning system. The building did not have a fire safety certificate. Escape routes were blocked trapping the students.\n\n“I was in Gujarat when an incident happened in Surat wherein students were falling from a building to save themselves from fire. Several disturbing videos of girls jumping from the building had emerged back then. It was a tragic incident and we did reporting from there for two days. The coaching centre was sealed, the accused were arrested and the matter came to a closure. Two days after, there was a big leader’s show in Ahmedabad, I asked my editor if I should go to Ahmedabad since the culprits in this case had been arrested, and coaching had been sealed what shall I do. But he (the editor), said no! when the whole world will telecast the rally, you go to the houses of [Surat coaching fire] victims. Grab a child and get a bite from him saying “Modi uncle what did you do?” Mishra said.\n\nHe further delved into what could have been the outcome of getting such a statement from the victims and how making the victims say “What did you do Modi uncle, get me my sister back” would have defined the public perception of the incident and Prime Minister Modi.\n\nNotably, while Shubhankar Mishra did not explicitly name which news channel or the editor he was talking about, Mishra’s LinkedIn profile and old videos of coverage of the Surat coaching fire incident confirm that he was working at TV9 Bharatvarsh. Although Mishra did not name the editor who asked him to get a statement against PM Modi, from the coaching fire tragedy victims, netizens are speculating that it may have been Vinod Kapri or Ajit Anjum who worked at TV9 Bharatvarsh in 2019 and are rabid Modi haters.",

		"title": "NBDSA asks News18 to pull down interview of Bageshwar Dham: Read how the media body has been passing anti-Hindu orders",
		"text": "The News Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) on Thursday (7th November) asked News 18 media to take down an exclusive interview of Hindu spiritual leader Bageshwar Dham Sarkar (also known as Dhirendra Krishna Shastri) that was shared on their platform in July 2023. NBDSA stated that they had sought a response from News 18 based on a complaint from one Pune-based techie Indrajeet Ghorpade, and the channel has failed to respond within a stipulated time period.\n\nNBDSA directs News18India @News18India to take down the video of interview with Dhirendra Shastri aka Baba Bageshwar after finding that it promoted superstition and communal disharmony.\n\n\n\nNBDSA passed the order in a complaint filed by @jeetxg pic.twitter.com/Jv5hTF1YKm — Live Law (@LiveLawIndia) November 7, 2024\n\nThe complainant mentioned that in the interview, Bageshwar Baba promoted his supernatural powers and the channel allowed it to be shared, breaking the regulations of news broadcasting and digital standards. The complaint also alleged that Shastri promoted the idea of Hindu Rashtra and the love jihad “conspiracy”. As per the reports, Ghorpade who is an activist has earlier filed several complaints against the channel.\n\nFollowing this, the NBDSA stated that Shastri promoted superstition during the interview and that his statements concerning Hindu Rashtra were divisive in nature. “The seer who was invited by the broadcaster made several claims during the broadcast, which promoted superstition. Furthermore, during the broadcast, several statements were made by the seer concerning Hindu Rashtra and religion, which were divisive in nature, such as that in order to live in India it would be mandatory to say ‘Sita Ram’ and that Islam asked men to trap young Hindu girls in love jihad and then kill them,” the NBDSA headed by former SC judge AK Sikri said.\n\nImage- News18\n\nIt added that the response of News 18, claiming that what Dhirendra Shastri said was his own personal views and not the views of the channel, was not satisfactory. It mentioned that Shastri mentioned several instances of his alleged ‘supernatural powers’, promoting superstition and occult practices, like finding lost cattle and jewels of people, and making religious proclamations that were divisive in nature.\n\nAs per the original NBDSA order obtained by OpIndia, the show violated the principles of Self-regulation which enjoins the broadcasters to refrain from advocating or encouraging superstition and occultism. The complainant stated that Shastri during the interview claimed that he had superpowers and that he could find missing animals, and diamonds using his powers.\n\nThe broadcaster responded to the allegation stating that it was a live interview and Bageshwar Dham Sarkar chose to answer questions referring to his personal life and ‘experiences’. It further added that the channel in no way would be responsible for such statements. Further, it added that Bageshwar Dham Sarkar clarified that he had no magic and that his predictions are to be taken as indicative and not as ultimate truth.\n\nHowever, the NBDSA observed that the program caused harm to the religious harmony between the communities and promoted superstition, occultism, and blind belief. “Such programs should not be broadcast,” it added.\n\nPrevious complaint by Ghorpade against News18 against ‘love jihad’ show\n\nIt is important to note that this is not the first time that the Pune-based activist techie has filed a complaint against News18. Ghorpade had dragged News18 and its anchor Aman Chopra in the year 2022 as well when the latter reported several incidents of love jihad during Navratri and Garba celebrations. Aman Chopra’s show at that time ‘Desh nahi Jhukne Dunga’ had reported about Muslim men allegedly beaten by local Hindu groups for entering into garba pandals by hiding their original identities. The men were then identified and handed to the police who booked them in three separate cases in Ahmedabad, Indore, and Akola.\n\nNBDSA order obtained by OpIndia\n\nIn the complaint against News18, the activist said that the anchor made the following tickers, “Garba mein ghusne se pehle pehchan patra dikhana hoga par uska virodh ho raha tha, ki kagaz nahi dikhayenge, garba mein jayenge. 7 logo pe FIR, Akola mein bhi Ahmedabad mein bhi Indore mein bhi, aur fir kehte hai Kagaz nahi dikhayenge. Khabar kya hai? Garbe mein ladkiyon ki photo lene par pitai, pakde gaye sabhi 4 yuwak vishes samuday ke, Ahmedabad mein 2 Muslimon ki pitai.” “These were repeated by the anchor which portrayed the entire Muslim community as demons,” the complainant added.\n\nDenying the said allegations, the News18 media broadcaster then had explained that the challenged program ‘Desh Nahi Jhukne Dunga’ was based on viral videos of three incidents showing certain individuals being beaten for deceptively attending Garba celebrations to record videos of women without their consent. In one of the cities, an FIR was also filed against such individuals. The broadcaster argued that these incidents were newsworthy, given allegations that some people were concealing or misrepresenting their identities to gain entry to the Garba events. The broadcaster also clarified that the program did not condone violence.\n\nThe broadcaster further noted that other TV news channels had also aired the viral videos, and the incidents were also given wide coverage by various newspapers. It explained that the challenged program also raised the question of whether it was inappropriate for members of the Muslim community to attend Garba celebrations and why some individuals were entering the event using falsified documents.\n\nGiven this context, the media platform questioned how the program could be viewed as communal or as promoting hate, as alleged by the complainant. The broadcaster pointed out that the incident involving seven individuals allegedly entering Garba festivities in Indore by concealing their identities was breaking news at the time.\n\nIn response to one of such incidents in Indore, the then Culture Minister of Madhya Pradesh had stated that Garbas had become a medium for “Love Jihad.” Additionally, the broadcaster, News18 in the year 2022 mentioned that the demand for identity verification prior to attending Garba celebrations was raised by local committees to ensure the safety of women and to maintain law and order.\n\nThe NBDSA, however, at that time also observed that the challenged broadcast was a news report on viral videos from Ahmedabad, Indore, and Akola, showing certain individuals being physically assaulted for just attending Garba celebrations. While NBDSA acknowledged that the broadcaster had merely reported on these incidents as they occurred in those cities, it noted that the tickers used during the interview gave a ‘communal tone’ to the broadcast. “These phrases created an impression that men from a specific community were miscreants or criminals aiming to deceive or harm women of another community,” the NBDSA said deciding to caution the broadcaster against using such language in future broadcasts.\n\nLove Jihad downplayed by Islamist supporters, termed it as conspiracy\n\nIt is crucial to note that incidents of Love jihad have been downplayed by leftists and their supporters giving a clean chit to the Islamists who deliberately trap Hindu women into love affairs and then force them to convert their religion. The leftists Islamists and their supporters consider Love Jihad a hoax and usually term it a conspiracy. However, OpIndia has reported several such cases from across the country with relevant evidence and legal reports exposing the sickening mentality of the Islamist community. During the NIA raids on the banned terrorist organization PFI, the authorities also recovered several incriminating documents in which specific mentions of Love jihad were made. The Islamists had made calls to the Muslim community asking them to trap Hindu women and convert them. Monetary rewards for doing the same were also announced. However, the Centre imposed a ban on the terrorist outfit in the year 2022.\n\nIn the given case also, Pune-based activist Ghorpade downplayed the incidents of Love Jihad and called it a conspiracy. He, in his complaint against New18 in the year 2022 stated that the latter was trying to allegedly spread hatred in the society by ‘demonizing’ the entire Muslim community. Ignoring the safety concern of the women attending Garba, and the fact that the Muslims had hidden their original identity to enter Garba pandals, Ghorpade stated that the channel glorified the assault over the Muslim men in Indore, Ahmedabad, and Akola respectively. He said that Shastri also during the interview with News18 recently promoted the idea of Hindu Rashtra and the love jihad “conspiracy”. Following this, the NBDSA directed the media to take down the interview from all its platforms.\n\nFive shows of News18 were issued notice by the NBDSA in 2022 accusing it of spreading ‘communal hatred’\n\nIn 2023, the NBDSA issued notices against 5 shows by News18’s Aman Chopra and alleged that the anchor instigated communal hatred by ‘deliberately’ targeting the Muslim community. “Chopra targeted, vilified, and castigated the entire Muslim community for the actions of a few miscreants and gave an incident a communal tilt,” the NBDSA had said as it fined Rs 25,000 to News18.\n\nOne show aired on 4th October 2022, in which Chopra, as per the complainant, termed police action of caning against the accused Muslims as ‘Dandiya’. The Muslims in Kheda, Gujarat. The accused Muslims had reportedly attacked the garba event after which police resorted to caning. The second show aired on September 29th, 2022 where Chopra allegedly reported about the Muslims barging into the garba events in Ahmedabad, Indore, and Akola. The complaint stated that the anchor allegedly portrayed all Muslim men as criminals trying to deceive Hindu women.\n\nGujarat Police flogging accused Islamists in the chowk in Kheda, Gujarat\n\nThe third show by News18 was aired on 5th August where the channel reported about sharp rise in the Muslim population in border areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bangladesh. The complainant then complained that the show and the channel tried to portray all Muslims as intruders. Interestingly, all the above three complaints were also filed by Pune-based activist Ghorpade.\n\nThe fourth show aired on January 18th, 2022 when the channel reported about UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s ’80-20′ comments. This time the complaint was filed by the Citizens for Justice and Peace and one Anuj Dubey who said that Chopra’s reporting was biased and partial. As per them, Chopra used statements like “20 were ganging up against 80 who were Hindus.” News18 India was fined Rs 50,000 and ordered to remove videos of the broadcast.\n\nThe fifth show that was challenged aired on July 28th, 2022, and was about the murder of Praveen Nettaru in Dakshina Kannada. As stated by the NIA, Praveen Nettaru was murdered by the PFI ‘killer squad’ to create terror in the Hindu community and establish Islamic Rule by 2047. Based on the complaint filed by one Utkarsh Mishra, the NBDSA stated that Chopra, rather than holding a few miscreants accountable for the murders and violence, actually attributed the violence to the religion itself.\n\nPraveen Nettaru ran a chicken shop. He was killed by PFI Islamists. Image Source: File Photo\n\nNBDSA favors minority to portray its anti-Hindu stance?\n\nIt is further important to note that the News Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) has also allegedly been posing an anti-Hindu, anti-India stance. It has issued similar orders in the past too, sometimes downplaying the hijab issue or issue of religious conversion. It has evidently been siding by the minority community and issuing orders to several media houses whenever the latter attempted to expose the real faces of the Islamists.\n\n1. Notice against News Nation for airing show on ‘conversion jihad’\n\nIn 2021, the NBDSA issued a notice against another media channel named ‘News Nation’ for airing a show about ‘Conversion Jihad’. An NGO called CJP (Citizens for Justice and Peace) had lodged a complaint with NBSDA taking umbrage to the “Conversion Jihad” show by News Nation TV, anchored by Deepak Chaurasia. The complaint said that the anchor called one Maulana Syed Ul Qadri a ‘factory of lies’ and made him apologize on behalf of the entire Muslim community.\n\nThe complaint also said that there was an “attempt” to promote “Islamophobic” ideas during the show and that some of its clips on Twitter, which received thousands of likes and retweets promoted hate against the Muslim community. The NGO claimed that such programs must not be aired as they may hurt the “composite and diverse” culture of India and that it may lead to violence.\n\nNews Nation TV had in turn said that the channel or the anchor cannot be held responsible for statements made by the guests in the program, but, had tendered an unconditional apology if the statements had hurt anyone. The NBDSA had ordered for the show to be deleted upholding the notion that any harsh reality being discussed in the media amounts to “Islamophobia”.\n\nConversion Jihad is a reality that the mainstream media, the organizations that govern the media, and the political class, on the whole, want to push under the rug. There are hundreds of cases where Hindu women have been forcefully converted to Islam either by deceit or force. There are other cases where Hindu women are even brutally murdered and/or raped when they find out the real identity of the perpetrator and refuse to convert to Islam. OpIndia has time and again reported several such cases from across India with legal pieces of evidence. All such reports can be read here and here.\n\n2. Notice against Times Now Navbharat for airing show featuring love jihad\n\nOn June 3rd, 2023, activist Indrajeet Ghorpade had filed a complaint with Times Now Navbharat, raising concerns about the tickers and headlines displayed during the show, which he argued promoted ‘demonization and hatred against the Muslim community’. The show named ‘Love to banana hai, Hindu betiyan nishana hai’ talked about love jihad and the modus operandi of how Islamists trap Hindu women and then force them to convert to their religion. Ghorpade alleged that numerous generalized statements targeting the Muslim community were made without any factual basis. He also said that the murder of Shraddha Walker was repeatedly presented with a ‘communal slant, casting Muslim men in a suspicious light’.\n\n“Shraddha Walker was incorrectly cited as an example of Love Jihad. Further, during the broadcast false generalized statements were made to target Muslim men, by stating, ‘Kyun har jageh, Hindu naam rakh ke ek Hindu ladko fasane ka kyun aata hai saamne ye bataiye? Aisa kyun hai ki jo ladki fasti hai woh Hindu hai aur jo ladka maarta hai woh Muslim nikalta hai baad mein? Kyun dhoka diya jata hai iss tarah se?’ Another panelist baselessly claimed that this is an organized crime against our (Hindu) women,” the complaint read.\n\nNBDSA then imposed a fine of Rs. 1 lakh on Times Now Navbharat. It observed that several Muslims married Hindu girls, however the same did not warrant for news anchors to make generalized statements.\n\nThe order stated, “Some such instances should not lead to making generalized statements regarding inter-faith marriages by giving it a communal color. Every citizen, from whichever religion, has a right to marry a person of his/her choice, irrespective of the religion to which he/she belongs. Merely because a Hindu girl married a boy of another faith would not be tantamount to love jihad unless it is established that such a Hindu girl was duped or coerced into the marriage. Further, because of few incidents of such forced marriages, an entire community cannot be branded. Thus, it was not proper to generalize the incidents with the tickers such as ‘Love to banana hai, Hindu betiyan nishana hai’ Jihadiyon se Beti Bachao.”\n\n3. Notice against Aaj Tak and its show ‘Black and White’ by Sudhir Chaudhary\n\nThis specific complaint was recently filed by activist Indrajeet Ghorpade, this time against the ‘Black and White’ show, hosted by Sudhir Chaudhary and aired on Aaj Tak. In the complaint, Ghorpade alleged that the anchor made false statements aimed to incite hatred and fear against the Muslim community. He wrote that “the broadcasters ignored the widespread discrimination faced by Dalits and Muslims, opting instead to air a show that portrayed Muslims as rioters and labeled Muslim areas as ‘mini-Pakistan.'”\n\nThe show by Chaudhary notably reported on the Islamist violence in Nalanda district of Bihar during Ram Navami celebrations in March 2023. As reported, a religious mob in Nalanda set fire to Hindu shops and their warehouses, causing extensive damage. Chaudhary while reporting stated that Islamists aimed at making India an Islamic country. “Today they have Muslim area, tomorrow they might want Muslim Bharat. Have you ever heard of Hindu area, Sikh area, Parsi area?” Chaudhary reported.\n\nComplaining against this, Ghorpade stated that “the anchor failed to mention that a mosque was burnt down in Nalanda, Bihar, that Muslim shops and houses around the mosque were also burnt down and that the cops did not arrive for several hours while the burning was taking place, and when they did arrive, they misbehaved with Muslim women and looted the houses. The anchor kept blaming Muslims for the violence.”\n\nOriginal document obtained by OpIndia\n\nThe complainant stated that, throughout India, areas are often segregated by caste and religion. A simple search on Google Maps for terms like Jain Colony, Hindu Colony, Sindhi Camp, Brahman Colony, or Parsi Colony reveals numerous such locations. Even when areas are not explicitly named after a specific religion or caste, ghettoization remains widespread across the country.\n\nThe NBDSA noted that there would have been no issue with the broadcast if it had limited its focus to analyzing incidents of communal violence. However, by displaying tickers like “Aaj Muslim ilaake, Kal Muslim Bharat,” “Aaj ilaaka, kal zilla, parso desh,” and “Aapne kabhi Sikh ya Parsi ilaaka suna hai” during the program, the broadcast took on a very different tone.\n\nSimilar directives against Aaj Tak\n\nApart from these three orders, the NBDSA issued similar directives to several other media houses schooling them on ethics and impartial stance. Another episode of the ‘Black and White’ show, hosted by Sudhir Chaudhary that covered former US President Barack Obama’s remarks on minority protections in India during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to the US was taken cognizance of by the NBDSA. The NBDSA found that beyond violating the principles of ‘Objectivity and Neutrality’, the broadcast also breached the Specific Guidelines for Anchors, which require that “all programs must be presented in an impartial, objective, and neutral manner.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThe NBDSA is an ‘independent’ body established by the News Broadcasters & Digital Association (NBDA), which represents private television news, current affairs, and digital broadcasters. It identifies itself as the collective voice of news, current affairs, and digital broadcasters in India and is fully funded by its members. NBDA is one of the two major broadcast media federations, the other being the News Broadcasters Federation headed by Arnab Goswami.\n\nNBDSA claims that its goal is to safeguard its members from engaging in unfair or unethical practices and to uphold the credibility of television news broadcasters, digital news media, and other related entities. Currently, the body is headed by former SC judge AK Sikri.\n\nHowever, it has time and again been slamming notices to media houses that attempt to expose the sickening mindset of the Islamists. It has issued media houses for airing shows on love jihad, conversion jihad, hijab issues, Islamist violence, etc, ultimately downplaying the severity of these issues faced by the majority Hindu community. The Islamists target Hindu women, force them to convert to their religion, attack Hindu festivals, and create violence, they practice jihad (war) against the community with an aim to make India an Islamic nation by 2047. Very recently, the Islamsits (different from the entire Muslim community) have began practicing ‘thook’ and ‘unrine’ jihad where they contaminate the food being served to the customers. Several such incidents have also been recently reported by OpIndia.\n\nIt seems difficult to believe but Islamists have a unique agenda to fulfill and that is to make India an Islamic Nation by the year 2047, the year when India would complete 100 years of independence. Several proofs exposing the same have been gathered by the NIA during the raids on terrorist outfit PFI hideouts. Despite this, the media houses allegedly targeted for reporting the truth look concerning and almost like an deliberate act. The authorities involved need to thoroughly verify the incidents, ground realities, and concerns of the surviving majority community in India as well before allegedly giving clean chit to Islamists almost every time.\n\nFurther, in an attempt to ‘protect’ the minorities, the authorities allegedly ignore the seriousness of issues like love jihad, conversions, and Islamist violence, further allegedly doing injustice against the majority population of the country. The media should be impartial and ethical in reporting issues, definitely yes! But isn’t it the primary responsibility of the media to show the truth to society and make them aware of the realities? Reportedly, no action is taken against media houses or digital publishers when they attempt to allegedly shield minority people accused of various crimes. Is that what ‘ethics’ looks like? Is that what ‘journalism’ looks like?\n\nIn many of the cases mentioned above, several broadcasters allegedly targeted and schooled by the NBDSA based on the complaints from alleged leftist, Islamist supporters clarified that they were reporting what was already out in the public domain or that the opinions expressed during the shows by the studio guests if any were their personal, but to no avail. They also mentioned that in several of the cases like Muslims caught in garba events, police action had been taken and that FIRs had been booked, therefore the credibility could not be doubted. But eventually, the media houses were ordered to take down the reports, accusing them of allegedly portraying the Muslim community as ‘demons’.\n\nIn the given case also, the News18 media house has been asked to take down its exclusive interview with Hindu spiritual leader Bageshwar Dham Sarkar (also known as Dhirendra Krishna Shastri).",

This day is celebrated globally as Guru Nanak Jayanti every year. This year the day is being observed on 15th November. Devotees pay homage to the founder of Sikhism on their holy day, starting with a “Akhand Journey” and paying tributes to his teachings.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi also extended warm greetings on the occasion and stated that the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev serve as an inspiration to further the spirit of compassion, kindness and humility.\n\nGreetings on the auspicious occasion of Sri Guru Nanak Jayanti. May the teachings of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji inspire us to further the spirit of compassion, kindness and humility. May it also motivate us to serve society and make our planet better. pic.twitter.com/gHlfrGBF9a — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 15, 2024\n\nNotably, there were many interesting facets of the life of the founder of the Sikh religion, including his companions Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana. Bhai Bala is well-known for giving the birth certificate of Guru Nanak and for his memorials at many locations around India, particularly in Nanakana Sahib, Saidpur, Kashmir and Assam. He was a close aide of Guru Nanak during his Third Udasi at Bhai Lalo’s home in Saidpur.\n\nWho was Bhai Bala?\n\nBhai Bala was born into the Hindu Jatt family of Talvandi Rai Bhoi (often written Bhoe) or Talvandi Sabo, the place where Guru Nanak grew up. His father was Chandra Bhan. The area, now called Nankana Sahib, was situated on the side of the border that was drawn through Punjab during the British division of India into two nations based on religious differences. The two were playmates in Talvandi as children, and Guru Nanak was three years older than him.\n\nHe traveled with Guru Nanak from Talvandi to Sultanpur, where he remained for a long time before going back to his village. He left his hometown on the request of Rai Bular. The Bala Janam Sakhi a 16th-century biography of Guru Nanak, written by Bhai Bala states that he latter departed Talvandi at Rai Bular’s request to meet the former at his house in Saidpur. Guru Nanak had already left Sultanpur for his foreign travels. After the death of Guru Nanak. Bala was summoned by Guru Angad, Nanak II, to travel to Khadur and tell him about the First Guru’s life.\n\nThe Mahima Prakash, an ancient scripture, contains a rendition that is extremely visual and reads, “Guru Angad one day spoke to Bhai Buddha, ‘Seek the disciples who accompanied the Master, Guru Nanak, on his journeys far and wide, who heard his preaching and reflected on it, and who witnessed the many strange events that occurred; secure from him all the circumstances and have transcribed a volume which may please the hearts of those who should apply themselves to it.’ Bala Sandhu (Bala Bhai) made his appearance.”\n\nAnother Sikh, Paira Mokha, wrote down the stories that Bhai Bala told in Gurmukhi characters while Guru Angad was present. The end product is a hagiographical narrative of Guru Nanak’s life known as Bhai Bale Vali Janam Sakhi. Bhai Bala related the incidents about Guru Nanak’s life, which were included in Paida Mokha’s Janamsakhi, which was composed at Guru Angad’s guidance. Baba Budha ji, Guru Angad, Bhai Bala, and other Sikhs contributed their knowledge about Guru Nanak. However, as he was the one who started the tale, it became known as Janamsakhi Bhai Bala eventually. Dr. Trilochan Singh admitted that Bhai Bala is mentioned by both Mahima Prakash and Mani Singh Janmasakhi.\n\nAccording to Janam Sakhi Bhai Mani Singh, Bhai Bala was with Guru Nanak when he was a child, but not during the first two Udasis. He did not accompany Guru Nanak fourth Udasi, as Bhai Mardana stayed with him. It stated, “Baba (Guru Nanak) said, ‘Travels to two directions first and second Udasis have been completed and travel to Udasis to two directions (third and fourth Udasis) still remain.” Mehta Kalu ( Guru Nanak’s father) bowed and responded, “Whatever he does, he will only speak of good.” Following his departure, Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana both bowed to Guru Nanak and accompanied him.\n\n“Yes, I have already forgotten that I did not go with you,” conveyed Bhai Bala to which the Guru Nanak replied, “Bala, let’s go to the Northern Udasi.” Thus, Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana both went forward with Guru Nanak, per Bhai Mani Singh Wali Janam Sakhi appended at Dr. Kirpal Singh (Edition) Janam Sakhi Prampra, Page 364.\n\nGurdwara Bhai Bala Tapiana Sahib Khadur Sahib (Source: sikhphilosophy.net)\n\nThe “Soochak Prasang,” penned by Bhai Behlo during the reign of Guru Arjan Dev, also makes reference to Bhai Bala. He mentioned, “At the holy city of Khadur, Bala breathed his last. Guru Angad performed the rites with his own hands.” He also pointed out that Bhai Bala’s samadhi is at Khadur Sahib and that his family is still residing in Nankana Sahib. At Khadur Sahib, Bhai Bala passed away in 1544. The location where his mortal remains were burnt is marked with a memorial platform inside the Gurdwara Tapiana Sahib grounds.\n\nWho was Bhai Mardana?\n\nBhai Mardana was the son of a Muslim Mirasi (caste of hereditary minstrels and genealogists) couple, Badra and Lakkho, of Talvandi Rai Bhoe, now Nankana Sahib, in the Sheikhupura area of Pakistan. He was born in the year 1459 and was a long-time associate of Guru Nanak during his many travels both inside and outside the country. He was ten years older than the Sikh guru and the two were childhood friends. Both Bhai Mardana and Guru Nanak grew up in the same village.\n\nAccording to the Miharban Janam Sakhi, the former, who was ten years his senior had been his friend since he was a young boy and had sung him songs from the Bhagats (Kabir Ji, Trilochan Ji, Ravidas Ji, Dhanna Ji and Bern Ji). As a young lad, Guru Nanak reportedly gifted Bhai Mardana a string instrument made out of reeds to play on when he sang the hymns, according to Ratan Singh Bhangu and Prachin Panth Prakash.\n\nStories of Guru Nanak’s hospitality and kindness were widely circulated since he was hired to manage the Nawab of Sultanpur Lodhi’s granaries and stores. Bhai Mardana, who was already married and had two sons and a daughter, desired to go to Sultanpur to collect his reward. In the meantime, Mehta Kalu, the father of Guru Nanak, gave him the task of traveling to the region and reporting on his son’s well-being. He never left Guru Nanak’s side again after reaching Sultanpur. As Guru Nanak chanted the grandeur of God, he played the rabab or rebeck.\n\nGuru Nanak asked Bhai Mardana to come with him as he was ready to spread his message throughout the world. He was hesitant since he didn’t want to leave his family until his daughter had tied the knot and didn’t have the money to do so. However, Bhai Bhagirath, a follower of Guru Nanak, purchased the necessary provisions and Bhai Mardana was able to marry off his daughter. At that point, he was prepared to travel with Guru Nanak.\n\nThe biographers have depicted several amusing scenarios involving Bhai Mardana’s touchy behavior and his hunger to lighten the intensity of the travels. When the likelihood of receiving the next meal appeared uncertain, he reportedly acted frantically. When Guru Nanak advised him to be patient and have faith that something would come up, he was not readily persuaded. He always preferred to keep a supply of food on hand so that he would never have to be hungry. Hunger phobia was a serious issue for Bhai Mardana when he thought of going without rations.\n\nAccording to the Puratan Janam Sakhi, Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana had not gone far from Sultanpur when the latter lamented his hunger and urgent need for food. Guru Nanak highlighted the village they had passed and remarked that the Khatris of the Uppal caste would provide him with plenty of entertainment if he went there. He took that route, and when he reached the settlement, he discovered that everyone was quite kind. He received plenty of alms and a lavish meal. Puratan Janam Sakhi unveiled that Guru Nanak rolled on the ground in laughter as he witnessed him return with a package.\n\nAfter realizing the strangeness of his actions, Bhai Mardana was unsure of how to dispose of the items he had gathered. When the Guru explained to him that he would be burdened more by these items, he threw the bundle away. Numerous accounts in the Purantan Janam Sakhi depict Bhai Mardana in despair due to excruciating hunger or terrifying dread, with Guru Nanak or nature providing him with some sort of miraculous support. The two were once traveling in a secluded forest when they were abruptly overtaken by a strong storm. The storm was so bad that forest trees started to fly.\n\n“True sovereign, thou hast brought me to my death in this forest. I shall not here get a shroud nor a grave,” he addressed Guru Nanak while shaking with fear. Guru Nanak advised him to maintain his composure but he stated, “I have not faced a calamity like this in my life. What is going to befall my poor soul today?” A fire erupted then. There was a conflagration on all four sides and smoke everywhere. “Farewell, life,” he stated as he buried his face and collapsed on the ground. However, water flowed in streams as thick clouds loomed. “Raise thy head, Mardana and take thy rebeck,” declared Guru Nanak and sang, “If the fear of God is in the heart, all other fear is dispelled,” as he played the strings.\n\nPuratan Janam Sakhi narrates that the Mughals captured Bhai Mardana and Guru Nanak at Saidpur. The former was tasked with leading a horse while holding its rein and the latter was given a weight to bear on his head. The Mughal commander Mir Khan noticed that his horse was behind him without reins and Guru Nanak’s package was floating a cubit above his head. “Had there been such faqirs here, the town should not have been struck,” Sultan Babar remarked after hearing about the miracle. Mir Khan urged him to witness it for himself.\n\nAlthough historians disagree on the exact location of Bhai Mardana’s death, it is generally accepted that he became unwell and passed away in Baghdad in 1534 while traveling back from the East (udasis). Guru Nanak performed the obsequies with his own hands while grieving. A modest monument was built in Bhai Mardana’s honor. The location is marked with an inscription in a combination of Arabic and Turkish on a wall inside an enclosure. The people of Baghdad referred to Bhai Mardana as Murad and he was regarded as Guru as he was ten years older than Nanak.\n\nTherefore, the inscription that was erected following Guru Nanak’s departure reads, “Guru Murad died. Baba Nanak faqir helped in constructing this building, which is an act of grace from a virtuous follower, 927 A.H.” Bhai Mardana seemed to have passed away at the age of 75 in December of 1534 AD. The memorial is located 2.5 kilometers from the train station, close to a cemetery. When Guru Nanak returned to Punjab, he told Bhai Mardana’s son Shahzada and other family members that he had gone back to his heavenly abode and requested them not to cry for him.\n\nAccording to other accounts, the presence and contribution of Bhai Mardana extended beyond the Guru Nanak’s lifetime. The following gurus were served by him after Guru Nanak’s death. He made certain that Sikh religious music will always be an essential component of their worship. He accompanied Gurus Angad Dev, Amar Das and Ram Das on his divine journey. In 1534, Bhai Mardana’s holy life came to an end in Kartarpur, where he passed away in the devoted presence of Guru Angad Dev. An incredible voyage in the company of gurus came to an end with his departure.\n\nThe fact that his father, Bhai Badra, was a gifted musician would have a significant impact on Bhai Mardana’s life. He demonstrated innate musical ability at a young age. His early years were marked by his melodic voice and deft rabab (stringed instrument) playing. He developed into a master of the Rabab and his songs had the ability to profoundly affect listeners. His work as Guru Nanak’s companion in promoting Sikhism via music was among the most significant facets of his life.\n\nBhai Mardana became an essential part of Guru Nanak’s journey when he began to disseminate the message of equality, unity and devotion to One God. Together, the two sang songs of God and composed music that conveyed tremendous spiritual understanding. Their musical trajectories transcended national borders. They visited many locations in Asia, India and even the Middle East. While traveling, Guru Nanak sang the shabads, or sacred hymns, and Bhai Mardana Ji played the rabab. People from various walks of life were drawn to their distinctive fusion of music and spirituality, surpassing socioeconomic class, religion, and caste.\n\nGuru Nanak and Bhai Mardana shared a spiritual link of friendship and companionship that went beyond the ordinary bond of a teacher and student. Guru Nanak, who understood that their union was a part of a divine design, was immensely grateful for his friendship. Bhai Mardana’s melodies played a crucial role in Guru Nanak’s regular utilization of music to spread his spiritual lessons. They collaborated to create shabads which still have an impact on the hearts and spirits of their devotees today.",

		"text": "The Union government designated 15th November as “Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas” in 2021 in honour of the valiant tribal freedom fighters as part of the year-long celebration of the 75th anniversary of Indian independence. The annual occasion is held to honour the tribal people’s contributions to the conservation of their cultural heritage and the advancement of Indian ideals like hospitality, bravery, and patriotism. Tribals opposed British colonial rule by organizing a number of tribal movements in various parts of India. These tribal groups included the Tamars, Santhals, Khasis, Bhils, Mizos, Kols, and many others.\n\nBirsa Munda, who is regarded as Bhagwan (Lord) by many tribal groups across Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, was born on 15th November. A national hero during his lifetime, Birsa Munda was a renowned freedom fighter, social reformer, and respected tribal leader who heroically opposed the exploitative system of the British colonial authority. He called on the tribals to “Ulgulan” (revolt), and he organized as well as commanded the tribal movement. He urged tribal members to uphold unity and understand their cultural roots and heritage.\n\nOn the occasion of “Janjatiya Gaurav Divas” Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Jamui, Bihar to mark the commemoration of Bhagwan Birsa Munda’s 150th birthday. A commemorative coin and postal stamp will be issued in his honour. Furthermore, he will launch and set the groundwork for other development initiatives totalling more than Rs 6,640 crore that would improve infrastructure in rural and isolated parts of the region and uplift tribal communities.\n\nIt is imperative for the people to always remember those who sacrificed their everything for the sake of the country. Notably, many of those known and unknown freedom fighters from the tribal community have led their communities and in their own ways, have contributed to the building the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation that we see today.\n\nBirsa Munda: The bane of British Empire\n\nLet’s begin with the individual whose birth anniversary was selected to commemorate the momentous occasion. Birsa Munda is a legend who has had a lasting influence on India’s struggle against the British, despite only having lived for 25 years. Tribal chieftain and young freedom fighter whose involvement in the late nineteenth century is remembered as a powerful symbol of opposition to British authority in India. Birsa Munda, a folk hero, religious leader and tribal independence warrior belonged to the Munda tribe. During the British Raj in the late 19th century, he led a major Indian tribal movement that emerged in the tribal belt that includes present-day Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chattisgarh. One of the key figures in Indian tribal movements against the British, he served as an inspiration to many tribes, including the Kharias and Oraons, who embraced him as their leader.\n\nImage via Wikipedia\n\nBirsa Munda was born in the late 19th century on 15th November 1875 in Ulihatu, Ranchi to Karmi Hatu and Sugana Munda. His life was profoundly impacted by her four years at Chaibasa. He had never before argued with the Christian clergyman. His braid was cut when he was attending the school, after which he left from there. He pondered over his society afterwards and made the decision to rid it of ignorance, poverty and illiteracy. He learned about the Ramayana and Mahabharata from a man named Panda during this period. He began bringing the people of his tribe together. He started getting tremendous support from the Munda tribes as their self-respect was awakened. People stopped attending church, began performing bhajans and kirtans with him and refused to bow down in front of the landowners.\n\nHe began to gain popularity as an effective leader who aimed to raise public consciousness by 1895. He spearheaded a campaign to demand that the British provide his Munda community and others tax exemptions during the 1894 famine. He was taken into custody in 1895 and given a two-year term in Hazaribagh Central Jail. However, he and his followers were committed to aiding the region’s starving population. As his influence grew, the Mundas in the whole region became more mindful of the need to organize. He was adored and known as “Dharti Aaba” by the locals who worshipped him.\n\nThousands of people were there to greet him when he was released from prison following two years of education. He then founded Birsaiyat, a spiritual group and began to be regarded as God. He initiated a struggle against the British in the area that was then Chhota Nagpur after establishing a successful organization and believing that the landlords, British, and Christian missionaries who pillaged the forest dwellers were the biggest foes of the tribal communities. He referred to the movement as “Ulgulan.”\n\nThe British government was rocked by the resistance of the Munda people. They decided to capture Birsa Munda at any cost. They launched an attack on the Dombari hill as soon as they learned that many people would be congregating there. The indiscriminate firing of bullets resulted in the martyrdom of thousands including women and children. Birsa Munda’s efforts persisted despite this horrific massacre. The British offered a prize of Rs 500 for capturing him because they believed that keeping him out for an extended period of time could be risky. It didn’t produce any results though.\n\nBirsa Munda and his supporters made life difficult for the British during the Munda-British wars that raged between 1897 and 1900. He stormed the Khunti police station in August 1897 with his four hundred bow-and-arrow-wielding men. When the two sides met on the banks of the Tanga River in 1898, the British army was initially routed, but many tribal chiefs in the region were arrested later.\n\nHe was eventually arrested by the British on 3rd March 1900 while he was sleeping in the Jamkopai forest in Chakradharpur. He was caught along with his tribal guerilla army. He died in Ranchi Central Jail on 9th July of the same year. The British government declared that he died due to Asiatic cholera, but it is also claimed that he was fed poison and glass in his food, which caused him to gradually deteriorate and he finally passed away under suspicious circumstances.\n\nRana Poonja Bheel who defeated Mughal emperor Akbar’s army\n\nThe history of the Indian freedom struggle is seen only as the fight against British colonialism, however, it is also crucial to understand that it is also a tale of resistance against the brutal Islamic invaders who attacked India prior to the arrival of British/European Christians from the 9th to the 18th centuries. Many courageous tribal warriors of this era not only decisively repulsed the Muslim tyrants but also drove them out of the frontier regions for years. Poonja Bhil was one such extraordinary tribal hero. He was a member of the Bhil tribal community and fought hard against the army of the Islamic invader Akbar in Haldighati.\n\nIt wouldn’t be an exaggeration to compare Rana Poonja Bhil to the great Maharana Pratap of Chittor. The story of Maharana Pratap’s valour in saving Chittorgarh’s impregnable fort is still ingrained in every aspect of the city because of the former’s support and bravery. Poonja Bhil was born on 5th October in the Merpur village of present-day Rajasthan, where his father was the head of the area. After the death of his father, he became the head of the Merpur state of Mewar at the tender age of 14. He started to make a name for himself because of his bravery, fearlessness, battle prowess and incredible leadership qualities.\n\nImage via Mai Bhi Bharat\n\nMeanwhile, the dark shadow of Islamic terror fell on Mewar which turned Poonja Bhil into ‘Rana’ Poonja Bhil. After the Islamic conqueror Akbar took control of Chittorgarh Fort in 1576, Maharana Pratap found himself in a precarious position. His family as well as near and dear ones had abandoned him in favour of the Mughal ruler. His brother Shakti Singh also left him. Maharana Pratap met Poonja Bhil during this period while he was wandering through the woods. The latter assured that he would assist him in protecting Mewar after Maharana Pratap informed him of the truth. The Rajput ruler then embraced him and called him his brother.\n\nAfterwards, a fierce battle of Haldighati took place which is often portrayed in a distorted manner by left-liberal historians. The truth ultimately came out and revealed that even the Mughal army consisting of lakhs of soldiers was unable to win the war, despite the claims of a Mughal victory. Poonja Bhil triumphed over the Mughal assault with the help of thousands of Bhil soldiers and Mewar fighters. Together with Bhil troops, Poonja Bhil and Maharana Pratap employed guerrilla warfare, which prevented the other side from winning.\n\nImage via Shriji Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur\n\nHe was dubbed ‘Rana’ Poonja Bhil because of the courage with which he defended Mewar. Rana Poonja Bhil’s name is known to represent courage and devotion in Indian history. The royal insignia and flag of Mewar were modified to honour the legacy created by Rana Poonja and Bhil soldiers in the Battle of Haldighati. The Rajput symbol was placed on one side, while the Bhil symbol was placed on the other.\n\nThe man against conversion and for tribal rights: Baba Kartik Oraon\n\nKartik Oraon also affectionately known by his followers as Baba Kartik Saheb was a brilliant tribal leader from the modern Indian state of Jharkhand who also participated in the Indian freedom movement of 1947. He served three terms as the Lok Sabha member for the Lohardaga Parliamentary constituency and was a politician who was deeply committed to the society he governed. He also became the Government of India’s Minister of Aviation and Communication as a result of his dedication to serving the country and its people. He dedicated his life to the betterment of the tribal people and worked tirelessly to defend and preserve tribal culture and life against evangelical aggression.\n\nImage via Prabhat Khabar\n\nOn 29th October 1924, he was born in the Kurukh tribe’s Karounda Littatoli village in the Gumla district of Jharkhand to Jaira Oraon and Birsi Oraon. He earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Bihar College of Engineering in Patna after graduating from high school in Gumla in 1942 and passing the intermediate examination at Science College in Patna. He visited Thakkar Bappa’s ashram after graduating with his matriculation and his motivation led Kartik Oraon to achieve several degrees. Afterwards, he relocated to England, where he completed his engineering degree from the Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow and Battersea College of Technology, London University.\n\nHe also attended the Lincoln’s Inn in London to study Bar-at-Law. He also designed the largest automatic power plant in the world for the British government in 1959 while spending nine years in England. It is now referred to as the “Hinckley Nuclear Power Plant.” In 1961, Kartik Oraon returned to India and assumed the position of HEC’s Superintendent Construction Designer. He was also responsible for developing the Central Library and BAU buildings.\n\nAfter being elevated to the position of Deputy Chief Design Engineer, he decided to work for the community and entered politics in 1962 after witnessing the state of the Chhotanagupar tribal people at the time. He was a great politician in addition to being a talented engineer. During the peak of the Bhoodan movement in 1968, under the leadership of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Ji, tribal land was being sold at low rates. Karthik Oraon pleaded with former Prime Minister late Indira Gandhi to prevent the tribal people from losing their land and becoming landless.\n\nHe succeeded in convincing her and plans were set in place to reclaim the tribal people’s lost land by introducing legislation on the matter. Birsa Agricultural University was founded in Ranchi as a result of his unwavering efforts. He helped create the “Tribal Sub Plan,” which serves as the foundation for many development programs currently being implemented by the union and state governments to promote the growth of tribes. He also established the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad organisation.\n\nThe conversion of tribal people to Christianity infuriated him. The Scheduled Castes/Tribes Order Amendment Bill 1967 was hence introduced in the Parliament in 1967. After carefully examining this bill, the Joint Committee of Parliament issued its recommendations on 17th November 1969. The committee had recommended, “2A. Notwithstanding anything contained in the parliament in Paragraph 2, no person who has given up tribal faith or and has embraced either Christianity or Islam shall be deemed to be a member of any Scheduled Tribes (Vide Para 2A, page 29, line 38 of the Schedule II of the report).”\n\nThe Scheduled Castes (SCs) case had already undergone a similar change in 1956, which stated, “3. Notwithstanding anything contained in Paragraph 2, no person who professes a religion different from the Hindu or Sikh Religion shall be deemed to be a member of Scheduled Castes.” The bill was not discussed in Parliament for a year, even though the Joint Committee had recommended it. The Christian Mission put a lot of pressure on Indira Gandhi to reject the law. The Christian Missionaries persuaded fifty members of Parliament to write to Indira Gandhi opposing the bill.\n\nKartik Oraon risked his political future by delivering a letter to Indira Gandhi on 10th November signed by 322 Lok Sabha members and 26 Rajya Sabha members, protesting against the initiative and making the demand that “she should accept the recommendations of the bill as it is a question of life and death of 3 crore tribals.” Behind the scenes, however, was a successful campaign of Christian missionaries who were both domestically and overseas were extremely alarmed by this bill.\n\nThe debate on this bill started in the Lok Sabha on 16th November 1970 and the Christian Chief Ministers of Nagaland and Meghalaya reached Delhi to create pressure. There were two Christian ministers of state in the cabinet. They also devised a strategy for the same. As a result, on 17th November, the administration proposed an amendment stating that “the joint committee’s recommendations should be removed from the bill.”\n\nKartik Oraon was scheduled to debate this bill on 24th November 1970. Congress sent a whip to its members of parliament in the morning to direct them to oppose the recommendations of the Joint Committee included in this bill. Kartik Oraon spoke for 55 minutes on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. It got to the point that even members of Congress were inclined to go against the whip and in favour of the Joint Committee’s recommendations.\n\nSensing the situation, Indira Gandhi declared that the measure would be discussed on the final day of the session and ended the debate. However, on 27th December, the Lok Sabha was dissolved, and the Congress silently approved of the conversion of tribal people. It would have been a positive start if the suggestions of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and Kartik Uroam had promptly been implemented. Currently, a large number of tribal people are being convinced to become Christians, with the northeastern areas of India being the most severely affected. Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland are now nearly exclusively Christian, according to the Center for Policy Studies (CPS) published report on the Religion Data Census of 2011. Mizoram has a 90.08 per cent Christian population among STs, while Manipur and Nagaland have respective percentages of 97.42 and 98.21.\n\nThis pattern also holds true for STs in other regions of India. As a result of their conversion to Christianity, many communities are effectively cut off from their long-standing indigenous faith and cultural legacy. Furthermore, individuals who continued to practice their native faith have been persecuted by the recently converted Christians. Additionally, the majority of the reservation privileges are usurped by Christian converts. Kartik Uroam foresaw this far earlier and dedicated his life to fighting for tribal rights.\n\nKartik Oraon was a fervent Hindutva devotee. He wrote ‘Beas Varsh Ki Kaali Raat’ after this law failed to pass. He noted in his work that the Hindu and tribal rites are complementary rather than in conflict. He asserted that tribal people were Hindus from the beginning of time, citing the lives of Nishadraj, Shabari, Kanappa and others as well as numerous incidents found in ancient Indian writings. He also expressed the same in many programs. Moreover, he observed in his book that more tribal people were converted to Christianity during independent India than during British control. Therefore, he insisted that the converted tribal people be excluded from the Scheduled Tribes category as a social crusader and lawmaker who cared about the cause of tribals.\n\nHe invited the religious leaders of the tribal people from all over India to logically demonstrate that the tribal people are Hindus. He said, “You tell us the auspicious songs sung in your communities on occasions like birth and marriage.” He pointed out that hundreds of mangal geets (auspicious songs) were sung with lyrics, “Mother Yashoda is rocking Lord Krishna’s cradle,” “Goddess Sita is admiring Lord Ram in the flower garden,” and “Mother Kaushalya is feeding milk to Lord Ram,” among others. His strong arguments had no counter.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Kartik Oraon unequivocally declared, “We do not eat food on Ekadashi. We celebrate Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra, Vijaya Dashami, Ram Navami, Rakshabandhan, Devotthan festival, Holi, Deepawali with great pomp and show. We came to be known as ‘Oraon’ by chanting ‘O Ram O Ram’ We were born Hindus, and will die Hindus.” On 8th December 1981, he collapsed onto the corridor floor of the Parliament House. He received treatment at the Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital, but his health worsened and he passed away.\n\nTantia Bhil: The Robinhood freedom fighter of India\n\nMaharathi Tantia Bhil who fought 24 continuous wars for 12 years to destroy British rule and remained undefeated is another name in the illustrious list of tribal people who etched their names in history. He was arrested only after a well-planned conspiracy. He was the patron of women empowerment and therefore he was also known as Tantia Mama (uncle). He was the messiah of the poor due to which he also received the status of God. Some western writers and British officers labelled him as the Robin Hood of India.\n\nHe operated in the regions of Central India, Central Province and Mumbai Presidency, where he had sounded the horn of freedom struggle against the British government. He was born in 1840 in Barda village of Pandhana tehsil in East Nimar (Khandwa district). Vanvasi organisations believe that the date was 26th January. His father’s name was Bhau Singh and his wife’s name was Kagaj Bai. Different historians have given the term “Tantia” varied meanings, but in actuality, it literally means “struggle” and the freedom fighter made it true in every sense of the word.\n\nImage via ScoopWhoop Hindi\n\nHe had a keen mind from an early age and had received training in bow and arrow, lathi, and sling. He had mastered the art of shooting a gun and used Dawa or Phalia as his primary weapon. He had become proficient at archery. He was also associated with the 1857 liberation struggle, where he accompanied Tatya Tope and learned the art of guerilla warfare from him. He was made to take an oath before Goddess Amja as a youngster by his father to always defend his sisters, daughter-in-laws and daughters. He even arranged the wedding ceremonies of 300 poor girls and worked for the upliftment of women.\n\nHis father died early and all the responsibilities fell on his shoulders. The landlord evicted him after he was unable to pay the rent for four years due to a bad harvest. He approached Shiva Patil, a friend of his father’s, about the situation since he and his father had jointly purchased the land, but the latter did not grant him any ownership rights. When he filed a case in the English court, the legal system rejected it alleging erroneous evidence. Tantia Bhil had no choice but to fight after failing to receive justice. One day he and his friends assaulted all of Shiva’s men and liberated his property from occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, he was arrested by the British government and sentenced to a year of rigorous punishment where he witnessed the atrocities inflicted upon the prisoners and the desire to fight for freedom grew stronger in his mind. The East India Company’s dominance in India ended with the revolution of 1857, and the British Crown took control of the country in 1858 and their atrocities and transgressions on the native population escalated. Britishers along with landowners and government began to exploit the common people in different ways. Hence, Tantia Bhil gathered ordinary Indians and tribals and began the fight for independence from the British.\n\nHe commenced his formal campaign for freedom from the British government in 1876. On 20th November 1878, he was arrested by deceit and put in Khandwa Jail, but escaped by jumping the wall along with his companions on 24th November 1878. He then strengthened the organization, gaining significant allies like Bijania Bhil, Daulia Modia and Hiriya. With them, Tantia Bhil began to control 1700 villages in parallel with the British authority. A special unit known as the “Tantia Police” was established by him and he also created mobile courts where justice was served.\n\nThe final seven years of his 12-year freedom struggle were crucial because the British government needed to establish a special task force. S. Brook, the commander of this team, had his nose severed by Tantia Bhil in an attack. He similalry, sliced a police officer’s nose when he confronted him while the former was posing as a barber. Tantia Bhil was victorious in his 24 battles with the British government. He also confiscated 400 times as much money from the British government’s treasury, landowners and revenue collectors. He disbursed it to all the less fortunate. He prevented anyone from starving to death, even during the famine. He repeatedly confiscated food grains that were being transported by train by the British government. It became well-known that nobody would go to bed hungry under his rule.\n\nAfter 1880, he gained reputation as a a miraculous figure in the areas of Central Province, Central India and Mumbai Presidency. He was accorded the status of God and people saw him as their leader. Pages 101 and 103 of the History of Madhya Pradesh Police state that after Tantia Bhil and Bijania Bhil were taken into custody and taken to Jabalpur Central Jail, they attempted to flee once more. However, Bijania, Daulia Modia, and Hiria were apprehended and hanged, which caused Tantia Bhil’s organization to become weak but the British failed to arrest all the members.\n\nThe British government took the help of Ganpat Singh, the husband of Tantia Bhil’s adopted sister to catch him on 11th August 1889. He was nabbed due to a carefully orchestrated plot when he reached her place on the day of Raksha Bandhan. He was first kept in Khandwa Jail and then he was transferred to Jabalpur Central Jail (present Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Central Jail). The Sessions Court of Jabalpur opened a treason case against him in addition to other criminal cases. It’s important to remember that thousands of people flocked to Jabalpur to see him, which led to the Central Jail area eventually being placed under curfew.\n\nOn 19th October 1889, Tantia Bhil was finally given a death sentence. On 10th November 1889, the United States newspaper New York Times reported on his arrest, highlighting him as India’s Robin Hood. He was hung in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Central Jail on 4th December 1889, after a mercy petition against the death sentence was denied on 25th November 1889. His lifeless body was dumped on the Patalpani Kalakund railway track following the hanging, ensuring the British government’s dominance and fear endure. However, their actions failed to remove his great deeds. A “Tantia Mama” temple in his honour was erected an it is said that even today any train which leaves from Patalpani stops for a while to salute him.\n\nChhattisgarh’s First Martyr: Veer Gend Singh\n\nSome names shine forth as imposing representations of tenacity and unwavering will in the history of the struggle for freedom. Among them, the extraordinary Veer Gend Singh stands out as a symbol of bravery. His tale exemplifies the unwavering will that drove the fight for freedom. His life unfolded against a backdrop of injustice and tyranny, pushing him into a role that would leave his mark on history. He was born in the furnace of colonial persecution. The Paralkot landowner, who raised the first call of the fight for liberation from the British, made an exceptional and unforgettable sacrifice. Gend Singh consciously responded to the unrelenting injustices meted out to his fellow countrymen by entering the sacred halls of the freedom struggle.\n\nImage via Prabhasakshi\n\nHaving been born into a world weighed down by colonial oppression, he observed the injustices and humiliations his people underwent at the hands of imperial authorities from a young age. One important area of the state of Chhattisgarh is Bastar and the British managed to seize it using their crafty methods. They were engaging in social, economic and moral exploitation of the indigenous people there. As a result, there was a mounting possibility that tribal culture could become extinct. As a result, the Bastar forests began to burn with rage. Gend Singh was Paralkot’s landlord at the time. He was a powerful, wise, astute and just man. He wanted the people in his community to be happy. They must not be taken advantage of in any manner. He made every attempt to fulfil this objective, but British stooges stood in the way.\n\nThe number of crimes committed against the tribes had risen dramatically by 1824. The Abujhmarias then turned to Gend Singh as their leader. He formed a tribal rebel movement in only a couple of months. He blew the trumpet against the British power as soon as his group was ready. Everyone was motivated to revolt in their respective regions by him. The same fire quickly spread through Bastar. The gentle and straightforward tribal warriors were prepared to sacrifice themselves and their lives for their homeland. The revolt was intended to liberate Bastar from British control. The first freedom movement in the nation began when he uttered the phrase “Bastar free of the British.”\n\nThe headquarters of Paralkot Zamindari was the site of the rebellion against British control. 165 neighbouring villages were included in this. The region of Paralkot has a border with Maharashtra and it is the area of Abujhmad. Due to its high forest cover, Abujhmad has remained and continues to be a safe place for people. The safest place for Gend Singh was the region encircled by mountains, rivers and thick forests. From here, he persisted in his fight against the British military’s armed forces. An entire army of tribal people with bows and arrows was geared up under his command. He had directly challenged the authority of the British.\n\nThe Abujhmarias, who lived in the present state of Chhattisgarh, used the Paralkot revolt in 1825 as a symbol of their disapproval of foreign domination. Their ire was primarily directed against foreign powers such as the British. The British authorities in the state were responsible for the crisis surrounding the identity of the Abujhmadia tribal people. Tribes of Madiya also grew tired of their policy of oppression. The goal of this insurrection was to obtain a world free from all foreign influences. The Paralkot movement was headed by Gend Singh, who had the backing of the other Abujhmarias. They sought to establish an Abujhmad where there would be no exploitation or plunder, under his leadership.\n\nThe revolutionaries had moved from Abujhmad to Chanda by 4th January 1825. The rebels led by Gend Singh began ambushing the British officers after looting the nomads who provided supplies. The Paralkot Rebellion is the historical name given to this movement. As a show of defiance, the Abujhmarias would move branches of the Dhanvada tree from one location to another. The message’s recipients needed to join the resistance before the leaves dried up. When the revolting tribals captured an Englishman, they would chop him to pieces. The Manjhis of the region led the uprising in various detachments. The rebels would meet in Ghotul at night to make plans for the following day.\n\nGend Singh had traveled to Jagdalpur to celebrate Dussehra in 1824, as he did each year. The British soldiers arrived during this period, sealed his palace and started pillaging the Paralkot region. He received information about it when he came back. He then convened a gathering of the local tribesmen and sounded an alert about a revolt against the British. They used the traditional weapons used by the indigenous tribesmen to do this. They also created a weapon out of bees in the jungle to deploy against the British.\n\nAlarmed by this, British administrator Agnew challenged a group of officials to decide who might put an end to this uprising. The meeting went silent for a while. It was an invitation to death to confront Gend Singh and his valiant people. The officers all sat with their heads down as a result. Everyone was reprimanded by Agnue for being cowards. Ultimately, Captain Pebey, the Chanda Police Superintendent, boldly assumed responsibility for putting a halt to this uprising and marched a large army towards Paralkot. He used strong military force to totally enclose Paralkot on 10th January 1825.\n\nGend Singh was apprehended. Captain Pebey’s joy now knew no limits, but he was so afraid that he didn’t even think it was worth the danger to prosecute them or bring them before higher authorities. Ten days later, on 20th January 1825, the British authorities hung Gend Singh, the courageous son of Chhattisgarh, in front of Paralkot Palace. Gend Sigh lost his life during the fight for independence and he became the first martyr of India.\n\nA tale of glroy and valour: Queen Durgavati\n\nThe name Queen Durgavati evokes a sense of fearlessness just by being remembered. This courageous woman put up a fight against the Mughals. She fiercely repelled the Islamic invaders, making them bow down in the face of her bravery. On the battlefield, she transformed into the fearsome Goddess Chandi and slaughtered the Mughals. Born on 5th October 1524 AD on Durgashtami as the daughter of Kirti Singh Chandel of Kalinjar, she was given the name Durgavati and after assuming control of Garha Mandla (Garha kingdom), she proved that “as the name so the quality.”\n\nImage via Reddit\n\nFrom an early age, she excelled in spear, lance, sword, bow, horseback riding, and swimming. Durgavati, who possessed strength, bravery, intelligence, and skill, was full of pride in her country, identity and respect for Hindu community, culture, and customs. Her father had to be taken to the palace for medical attention after he was hurt in a battle with Sher Shah Suri when she was a child. The residents were terrified and prepared for Jauhar when the Muslim ruler besieged the fort as he saw it as a good opportunity to launch an attack. However, in a demonstration of unwavering bravery, Durgavati made all the necessary preparations for the battle against him and kept him involved in diplomatic treaty proposals. She responded appropriately to his cowardly attempt to ambush her, defeating his army with fire and gunpowder bullets. He was blasted to bits in a pile of gunpowder in the same onslaught.\n\nShe married the Gondwana kingdom’s Yuvraj Dalpat Shah in 1540 AD and became the mother of a son named Veernarayan in a span of four years. However, time and fate had other plans, and King Dalpat Shah passed away in 1548 after a severe illness. She was only 25 years old at the time and her widowhood was nothing short of a catastrophic event. However, she kept her promise to her husband, made her child the king and took the responsibility of running the kingdom on her shoulders.\n\nShe was dedicated to the advancement and prosperity of her realm, which consisted of fifty-two forts. The state of Gondwana at the time included the northern city of Narsinghpur, the southern state of Bastar in Chhattisgarh, the eastern city of Odisha’s Sambalpur and the western city of Wardha, Maharashtra. The queen loved nature, was popular, was a good strategist and a protector of her people. Her kingdom was incredibly prosperous and everyone lived in harmony and love. She traveled around the state for her subjects, made policies and was engaged in their implementation. She constructed numerous dams and ponds. She adopted all the necessary measures to ensure the prosperity of farmers and encouraged the donation of land, metals and animal husbandry to them.\n\nThe modern-day capital of Madhya Pradesh’s culture and justice, Jabalpur, was created with Queen Durgavati’s vision in mind. She oversaw the construction of 52 ponds in Jabalpur, including Rani Tal, Cherry Tal, and Aadhar Tal. The many and dharamshalas she built demonstrate her commitment to religious policy. According to Abul Fazal’s account in Ain-e-Akbari, “During the reign of Durgavati, Gondwana was so prosperous that the people used to pay the tax in the form of gold coins and elephants.” This illustrates how joy and wealth peaked in the kingdom of Queen Durgavati.\n\nAfter Dalpat Shah died, Baz Bahadur of Malwa attacked the kingdom in an attempt to conquer it but he was defeated by her. He was compelled to flee to preserve his life when the queen humiliated him in combat. The stories of the queen’s bravery and the wealth of her realm began to spread over different parts. However, she encountered several hardships in her life. The evil eyes of her adversaries were focused on her state in addition to the difficulties of her personal life, the welfare of her subjects, and the effective administration of the state.\n\nShe was foresighted and adept at waging war and formulating diplomatic plans. Her army had 20,000 horsemen, a thousand elephants and a large infantry. She also set up ‘Nari Vahini’ with her helper Ramcheri as its commander. She embraced the principles of the same Indian traditions, which were drawn from religious books and earlier customs which is a prime illustration of her vision, equality, and bravery for women in Indian history. Akbar, the vicious, savage of the period, acknowledged his servitude in front of Queen Durgavati after she vanquished Baz Bahadur. Akbar then sent a message to bring commander Aadhar Singh and her favorite elephant, Sarman, to the court. However, she turned down the proposal, and let the flag of Hindu identity and self-respect fly high with pride.\n\nShe bravely prepared for the battle and rejected subjugation. Her army might not have been as large as Akbar’s, but her bravery, self-assurance and selflessness were far more impressive. Infuriated by Queen Durgavati’s response, Akbar dispatched Asaf Khan to take her on, but she ultimately defeated him on the battlefield, forcing him to run for his life. He unleashed another full-scale attack on 23rd June 1564. The Mughal army was routed when she struck back on the banks of Narai Nala, close to Jabalpur.\n\nEverywhere she went the Mughal army was crushed and only their devastation remained. Her terror spread throughout the enemy troops. The blood of the Mughals slaked the thirst of the sword waving in both her hands. She was bravely slaying the enemy on the battlefield on 24th June 1564, when an enemy arrow struck her arm. She hurled it away without pausing for a moment, and then another arrow struck her eye. She tried to extract it despite the intense pain, but the point of the arrow stayed lodged in the eye. The third arrow then struck the queen’s neck before she could recover.\n\nShe asked her commander Adhar Singh, who was involved in combat nearby, to chop off her neck in light of the severe circumstances. However, he became perplexed and pulled out his dagger to attain martyrdom and sacrificed himself. Veernarayan assumed command of the battlefield after him, but he too became a martyr as a result of fewer troops. The queen passed away at the age of 42.\n\n“Akbar’s attack on a noble and good queen like Durgavati was neither imperialistic nor justified,” according to historian Vincent Smith’s account of this conflict. The Samadhi of Queen Durgavati is made of white stones in Barena village, a few kilometers away from Jabalpur, near the battle site. The epitome of valor, QueenDurgavati is the pinnacle of consciousness and the strength of Sanatan culture and her significance permeates every aspect of Indian identity.\n\nRani Maa Gaidinliu and her fight to preserve Sanatan culture\n\nOn 26th January, the birthday of Padma Bhushan Gaidinliu Pamei popularly known as Rani Ma (Queen mother) Gaidinliu is celebrated as “Nari Shakti Diwas” by All India Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram. Kalum Kai (local temple) started by Rani Maa still exists. She was named Gaidinliu by her parents and became famous in history and the Indian psyche as “Rani Maa.” “Gai” means good and “din” means “to show the way.” Thus Gaidinliu means “one who shows the right path.” She spent her life was in accordance with her name. She sacrificed her life by showing the right and appropiate path to the society and for the protection of Indian religion and culture.\n\nImage via Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav\n\nShe resisted the Christian religion fostered by the British at the physical, mental and intellectual levels. She worked tirelessly to preserve Indian customs. She continued her efforts towards awakening the people towards Sanatan Dharma and its culture. Hence, she is respected in Indian society today on an equal footing with Mata (Mother) Ahilyabai Holkar, Mata Jijabai and Queen Lakshmibai. She was born on 26th January 1915 in Lanka, a small hill town in Manipur state in the family of Lothanang Pamei and Kachotlenliu Pamei.\n\nIt is commonly believed that a week or so prior to her birth, an unforeseen event occurred in Lanka that made everyone there fearful of a major disaster. The whole of Lanka was enveloped in darkness by the ominous clouds in the sky. Every day and night, people prayed to God to avert the tragedy as cloudbursts on mountains are a frequent occurrence and can occasionally cause serious accidents. The dark clouds in the sky began to shift two or three days after her birth and dispersed. The whirling clouds subsided on their own after a week and the sky was completely quiet for a while. People observed the unique connection between Gaidinliu Pamei’s birth and the worry of a serious natural calamity. At this point, the people of Lanka began to view her as God’s incarnation.\n\nAs time passed, Gaidinliu Pamei started meeting more people than before and solved their problems. One day she got information about a Kambiron resident Haipou Jadonang that he is awakening the people of his society to protect Sanatan Dharma and culture. He is developing a sense of faith in Hindu religion among people. She expressed her desire to meet this great person and approached him with her aides and the two met. They then decided to work together. Both of them started visiting homes to raise awareness of Sanatan culture and religion.\n\nThe conversion program run by the British now started facing opposition in the mountains. The program of conversion started failing. The British thought of imprisoning both of them. As a result, the police started searching for them day and night. However, the duo received a lot of support in the mountains. The common people put their heart and soul into saving their leader and started calling them “Mahaan Halchal (great stir). Haipou Jadonang was one day arrested by the British government.\n\nNow Gaidinliu Pamei alone took the burden of his unfinished work. She began to spend more time among the people now than previously. Her presence among them also made the local populace very happy. Now, a large number of people started joining her movement. The entire Naga Hills became imbued with Sanatan Dharma and culture which upset the Christian missionaries. The temptations offered by them for conversion were unsuccessful. They decided to end the great upheaval by luring a local man named Fujo and issued a warrant to arrest her.\n\nShe was arrested and put in jail and many attempts were made to torture her cruelly. She only received meals once every day and was sometimes famished for a week. She was housed in nearly every jail in northeastern India. Poisonous creatures, snakes and scorpions, were brought into her room while she was imprisoned in Manipur jail to kill her, yet all of these animals appeared to recognize her. Lore says she was never harmed by any of them. She had attained self-realization and had a profound feeling of God. Even jail officials started to revere her.\n\nShe frequently had to endure prison sentences punishment for years as a result of this. She shone with remarkable radiance. After Haipou Jadonang, Gaidinliu Pamei was the only influential personality in whom the entire Naga society had faith. Everyone considered her to be a part of God and considered it right to follow the path shown by her. The leaders vying for independence at the time met her, whose extensive social efforts were seen as a miracle by the entire Naga hill people.\n\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru once visited her in Manipur. She fascinated him so much that he referred to her as the Queen of East India. She began to be referred to by the nickname Rani in common parlance. She kept inspiring the citizens of North-East India to protect Indian culture. Even the average person there began to feel proud of Indian culture and civilization as a result. The British began to perceive all of this as an existential threat to their empire, and prepared Fujo, another influential leader, to oppose the initiative run by Gaidinliu Pamei.\n\nA massive operation was now underway to use financial means to convert the British-supporting Fujo Nagas to Christianity as she was imprisoned. Notably, similar religious conversion programs happened many times in India. From ancient times, forces including Saka, Kushan, Pallav, Parthian and others targeted small parts of the country. They also ruled there but at one time they had to completely assimilate themselves into the culture of this land. Gaidinliu Pamei kept informing the people of North East about all these facts. Even today, a large number of people in the North East follow the Hindu religion and culture.\n\nShe informed individuals who refer to Islam and Christianity as faiths that the only religion on this earth is human religion which is led only by Sanatan Dharma. Hence, Indian culture is the original culture of the whole world. The great freedom fighter was declared anti-India by the opposing forces. She also met the second Sarsanghchalak of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) MS Golwalkar also known as Guruji (teacher). She explained her views to him and he considered her the true daughter of India.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are only seven of the enormous number of courageous warriors and tribal leaders who made a lasting impression on history and their legacy continues to reverberate through the years as evidence of the transformational power of bravery and tenacity. Their deeds, which were firmly anchored in their tribal heritage, changed not only the path of history but also the fates of the people they fiercely defended. Their steadfast dedication to maintaining the religious and cultural identity of their tribe is among the most enduring features of their heritage.\n\nThe rich tapestry of rituals and beliefs that characterized their people was closely guarded by them, acting as a strong barrier during a time when colonial powers sought to undermine indigenous traditions and even afterwards. As they continue to have an impact, their attempts to inculcate pride and self-respect in the tribal community and other Indians serve as an inspiration for future generations to proudly embrace their roles. The movements launched by them demonstrated how diverse populations come together to work toward a shared objective.",

		"text": "500 years of continuous struggle of Hindus to reclaim the birthplace of Lord Ram culminated with Pran Pratishtha of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya making this Diwali even more special for Hindus across the world, especially for the city of Ayodhya. Substantial preparations are underway at the administrative level for the security and facilities of the devotees. In addition to the state police, central forces are also stationed there.\n\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has declared it a grand festival and invited everyone to join in and the people of Ayodhya have also shown great enthusiasm to celebrate Diwali in a grand manner to welcome their King Bhagwan Ram. All of the key administrative authorities have camped in Ayodhya and the police are holding regular meetings. Every nook and corner of the holy city is continuously monitored.\n\nThe Ayodhya police have informed the media that enhanced vigilance is being maintained at Nayaghat, Ram Ki Paidi, Ramkatha Park, Lata Mangeshkar Chowk, Saryu River Ghat, and Aarti Sthal, among other places. Paramilitary troops are patrolling on foot alongside the police. On this day, various tableaux linked to the life of Lord Ram are seen in the holy city.\n\nApproximately 10,000 security officers from various districts in Uttar Pradesh have been deployed to ensure the safety of this great Deepawali event. These police and security officials are equipped with cutting-edge weapons and security equipment for checks, among other things. The administration maintains that there is insurmountable security in Ayodhya.\n\n\n\nThis time, a goal has been set to illuminate 28 lakh lamps in Ayodhya. These earthen lanterns will be lit along the banks of Saryu. These lamps have been decorated since Wednesday morning (30th October). In addition, the entire Ayodhya Dham has been given a magnificent appearance. Similar preparations for Deepotsav are ongoing in the rural areas surrounding Ayodhya Dham.\n\nआज हमारे अयोध्या में छोटी दीपावली पर विश्व रिकॉर्ड बनने जा रखा है।\n\n28 लाख दियों से रोशन होगी राम नगरी।\n\n\n\nराम की पैड़ी,सरयू घाट और श्री राम जन्म भूमि मंदिर शाम को दीपक की रोशनी से जगमगाएगा।\n\nराम मंदिर निर्माण परिसर में काफी समय के बाद ये भव्य दिवाली होगी।\n\nप्रभु राम के वापस अयोध्या… pic.twitter.com/p61UUGDzU0 — DEMOCRACY (@DemocracyFact) October 30, 2024\n\nSimilar decorations are also visible at the train station, bus stop, and airport. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Trust has announced that Ayodhya will be decorated with indigenous goods. Saffron flags cover the entire city of Ayodhya. On this occasion, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will crown Lord Ram in Ram Katha Park. Deepotsav will commence once this program is completed.\n\nCM Yogi welcomed the crowd on this occasion and encouraged people to attend this historic event. He stated that after 500 years, thousands of lamps will be lit in Shri Ramlalla’s grand and divine temple in Dharmdhara Ayodhya Dham, which is built on his sacred birthplace.\n\n“Never seen a Diwali like this”: Mahant Ajay Das\n\nSpeaking to OpIndia, Ayodhya’s Mahant Ajay Das said that he is about 50 years old and has lived in Ayodhya since childhood. Ajay Das said he had never witnessed such a Diwali before.\n\nAccording to Mahant Ajay Das, Ayodhya, which previously had a low influx of devotees, is now crowded with people from all over the country, as well as foreign visitors. Ajay Das gives the credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the magnificent transformation of the “Dharmkshetra”.\n\nThe devotees of Lord Rama are more enthusiastic and aware than ever before\n\nOpIndia met with an officer from the security forces stationed in Ayodhya. On the condition of anonymity, he stated that the devotees who come now are more enthusiastic and aware than before. We were told that security procedures were normally reinforced every Diwali, but they are currently on high alert and taking extra precautions.\n\nAccording to the official, the number of lamps and devotees in Ayodhya exceeds previous records every year. He claimed that devotees visiting Ayodhya are disciplined and observe the rules. He believes that Lord Ram devotees’ minds have become more socially aware and this consciousness is attracting devotees to Ayodhya.\n\nTrade boom in Ayodhya\n\nOpIndia spoke to Vimalendra Srivastava alias Pattu, a businessman from Ayodhya. Pattu has a house near Teedi Bazaar, where he used to run a tent house shop. He told us that in the erstwhile scenario of Ayodhya, he had suffered losses of lakhs of rupees in the tent business. After this, he left this business and started a vegetarian food business.\n\nVimalendra Srivastava told us that now the atmosphere of Ayodhya has completely changed. There is an unending influx of devotees here now. Because of this, his food and beverage business is doing very well. According to Vimalendra, earlier he incurred losses instead of profits by investing a large capital, but now he is getting good profits even with less capital. He thanked Lord Ram for this.",

		"title": "London: Farmers protest against inheritance tax",
		"text": "On the 19th of November, thousands of farmers in Britain are set to demonstrate in Parliament Square in London against the removal of an inheritance tax exemption that has aided farmers to bequeath their farmlands to the next generations, alleging that this decision will jeopardise food production.\n\nIn what was called a measure to raise funding to restore public services, UK’s Finance Minister Rachel Reeves stated in October that farmers with land worth more than 1 million pounds ($1.26 million) will no longer be authorised to transfer their farms to their children tax-free after 2026. The opposition to this “tractor tax” is a fresh addition to a broader backlash against Reeves’ financial policies. Earlier, Minister Rachel Reeves raised the social security contributions of the employers to 15% to increase government revenue. A significant number of Britain’s largest companies have warned that proposed increases to employers’ social security contributions could exacerbate inflation. After the country’s firms, the Labour Party government’s desperation to increase its revenue has become a nightmare for the British farmers.\n\nAgricultural Property Relief from Inheritance Tax and the Labour Party’s “Tractor Tax”\n\nFlags, toy tractors, banners, and tractors are reaching London in one of the major farmer’s agitations in the United Kingdom. Several farmer protestors were seen holding posters and banners reading “Keir Starmer Farmer Harmer”. Along with more than 1800 members of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), its president Tom Bradshaw and thousands of farmers, TV presenter and farm owner Jeremy Clarkson and other noted personalities are also joining the farmers’ protest in Westminster.\n\nUK: An estimated 40,000 farmers are currently en route to London, furious about the government's new 20% inheritance tax on farms, which will leave countless farmers with no option but to sell their farms.\n\n\n\n\"Farmers will be liable for inheritance tax at 20% on farms worth more… pic.twitter.com/v7vbUaUlnO — Wide Awake Media (@wideawake_media) November 19, 2024\n\nThe protesting farmers are deeply concerned and outraged over the Labour government’s revisions to the Agricultural Property Relief (APR). As the name suggests, the APR is sort of an agricultural tax inheritance relief, which allows the farmers to pass on their farmlands to their future generations with certain tax reductions.\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch and others gather in Westminster to protest against inheritance tax (Source: Independent UK)\n\nAs per the existing framework, the farmers can pass on some agricultural property free of Inheritance Tax, either during their lifetime or as part of their will. In addition to land or pasture used for growing crops or rearing animals, agricultural properties like stud farms for breeding and rearing horses and grazing, land not currently being farmed under the Habitat Scheme, land not currently being farmed under a crop rotation scheme, the value of milk quota associated with the land, some agricultural shares and securities, farm buildings, farm cottages and farmhouses are covered under agricultural properties qualified for APR.\n\nSource: UK govt website\n\nAbout the period of agricultural land ownership or occupation, the rules say, “property must have been owned and occupied for agricultural purposes immediately before its transfer for: 2 years if occupied by the owner, a company controlled by them, or their spouse or civil partner, 7 years if occupied by someone else.”\n\nNotably, the Agricultural Relief until the Labour Party’s revisions of the rules, was 100% if “the person who owned the land farmed it themselves, the land was used by someone else on a short-term grazing licence, it was let on a tenancy that began on or after 1 September 1995.”\n\nThere are certain criteria for obtaining 100% agricultural relief for the property owned before 10 March 1981. However, in other cases, the agricultural tax inheritance exemption is cut short to 50%.\n\nComing to the changes to the existing framework announced by the Labour government in the budget, the government said that starting on the 6th of April 2026, only the first £1 million in combined commercial and agricultural property will be eligible for the full 100% inheritance tax exemption. Also, no changes have been made to the tax exemption granted on agricultural land transfers between spouses and civil partners.\n\n\n\nBeyond this threshold, landowners will pay inheritance tax at a reduced rate of 20% rather than the regular 40%. Unlike other types of inheritance tax, this tax can be paid in interest-free instalments over a 10-year period. The UK government says that this is in addition to all of the other spousal exemptions and nil-rate bands available to people for inheritance tax purposes. “This means that two people with farmland, depending on their circumstances, can pass on up to £3 million without paying any inheritance tax,” the government said.\n\nExplaining the requisite behind making these changes, the Labour government said, “The latest figures show that the top 7% (the largest 117 claims) account for 40% of the total value of agricultural property relief. This costs the taxpayer £219 million. The top 2% of claims (37 claims) account for 22% of agricultural property relief, costing £119 million. It is not fair for a very small number of claimants each year to claim such a significant amount of relief, when this money could better be used to fund our public services.”\n\nThe UK government claims that these changes to the rules of agricultural relief from inheritance tax will impact only the wealthiest 500 estates each year with smaller farms not affected by the changes.\n\nWhat the agitating farmers say and the Labour government’s doubling down\n\nWhile the government and the tax supporters contend that imposing a 20% agricultural inheritance tax will recoup money from the wealthiest farmers or those who have bought up huge farms as investments to benefit from its increasing cost, the protesting farmers argue that nearly 60% to 75% of the working farms may face a tax imposition. Moreover, the farmers’ unions say that in contrast with the high value of farmland on paper, the profits they earn are diminutive.\n\nSource: SkyNews\n\nThe NFU president Tom Bradshaw has said that around 75% of the working farms will fall under the scope of the agricultural inheritance tax. He also called the tax imposition as a “stab in the back”. “The impact for retail prices and shelf prices is going to have to be dramatic. It’s an inflationary budget for food production and you in this group have nothing left to give. It’s been nothing but a bad Budget and I’ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime,” Bradshaw said.\n\n“This policy has to change.”\n\n\n\nNFU President Tom Bradshaw (@ProagriLtd) updates after addressing a packed room of NFU members at the first session in Church House for the NFU mass lobby.#StopTheFamilyFarmTax #BackBritishFarming pic.twitter.com/u1Uv3f5ctT — National Farmers' Union (@NFUtweets) November 19, 2024\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Keir Starmer remains adamant about the government’s stance that a major portion of working farms will remain unaffected by taxation. “It is very important that we support farmers,” Starmer said adding that he is “confident” when he claims that a “vast majority of farms and farmers” will stay unaffected by the revisions to the tax exemptions.\n\nDespite the Labour government’s claim that the new reforms will only target the wealthiest estates, protesting farmers expressed concerns that the policy would jeopardise multigenerational family farms, threatening their ability to continue producing food and maintaining rural traditions. The Labour government claims that the changes to the tax exemption framework are required to fund essential public services such as the NHS and housing and that the reforms will primarily affect the richest estates, not small farmers and average-sized farms. However, the protesting farmers and their unions, such as the National Farmers’ Union, think the consequences will be far-reaching and that in addition to harming family legacies, these changes will also jeopardise the UK’s food security.",

		"text": "New Zealand is witnessing a major protest by the indigenous Maori people with thousands marching towards the national capital Wellington over a controversial bill redefining the Treaty of Waitangi. The country’s political theatre caught global attention when on the 14th of November, New Zealand’s youngest Member of Parliament Hana -Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke tore up a copy of the bill and performed a traditional Maori (Māori) haka dance joined by some others in the parliament as a mark of protest against the bill titled Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill.\n\nWhile the political drama led to a temporary suspension of the proceedings of the House, a video of the same went viral on social media.\n\nNew Zealand’s Parliament was temporarily suspended after Māori lawmakers performed a haka, a traditional dance, demonstrating their community’s anger and fear over a bill that aims to reinterpret the country’s founding treaty with its Indigenous people. https://t.co/nu55lS7Y8M pic.twitter.com/xLNIkMQagk — The New York Times (@nytimes) November 15, 2024\n\nThe 1840 Treaty of Waitangi and incessant clashes over the quest for ‘equality’ for all New Zealanders versus the preservation of Maori ‘rights’\n\nThe Treaty Principles Bill has been brought forth by the ACT New Zealand, a junior partner in the governing centre-right coalition government, to revise the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi). The Treaty of Waitangi is an 1840 agreement between nearly 500 Māori chiefs and the British crown. This treaty is of immense significance to Maori rights and governance in New Zealand, stressing mutual cooperation and the principles of protection.\n\nArticles 1 and 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi 1840 with English and Maori interpretations (Source: nzhistory.govt.nz)\n\nThe Treaty was a political agreement between the British and Māori to establish a nation and government in New Zealand. It outlines fundamental principles and contains three articles. In the English version, Maori relinquish sovereignty over New Zealand to Britain and provide the Crown the exclusive right to buy their lands, forests, fisheries, and other possessions in exchange for full ownership rights. They are also granted the rights and privileges of British subjects. Although the Maori version of the Treaty is believed to reflect the same meaning as the English version, there are significant variances such as the term ‘sovereignty’ being rendered as ‘kawanatanga’ or governance.\n\nSome Maori believed they were relinquishing control over their lands while preserving the authority to run their own affairs. The English version guaranteed ‘undisturbed possession’ of all their ‘properties’, whilst the Maori version guaranteed ‘tino rangatiratanga’ or complete authority over ‘taonga’ (treasures, which could be intangible). A New Zealand History article suggests that Maori and Crown negotiators had different understandings of the Treaty and thus making it a perennial issue of debate and contention. On various occasions, the Maori people have protested demanding the government to “honour” the treaty.\n\nArticle 3 of the Treaty of Waitangi\n\nWhile the ACT party advocates extending Indigenous Maori citizens’ treaty rights to all New Zealanders, regardless of ethnicity, the protesting Maori leaders and people who are taking out a nine-day march or Hikoi, argue that the alleged lack of consultation with Maori groups before tabling this bill violates the treaty’s key commitments. Meanwhile, the Waitangi Tribunal has also slammed the Treaty Principles Bill for allegedly undermining the partnership principle adding that it compromises their rights to self-governance and protection under the Treaty of Waitangi. Notably, the Bill was introduced 7th of November and on the 14th of November 2024, the bill passed its first reading in the parliament with 68 votes in favour, 54 against and one uncounted since Maori MP Hana was suspended.\n\n“Regarding the Crown’s policy development for the Bill, the Tribunal found the Crown’s process to develop the Bill has purposefully excluded any consultation with Māori, breaching the principle of partnership, the Crown’s good-faith obligations, and the Crown’s duty to actively protect Māori rights and interests. The Tribunal also found this policy process to be in breach of the principle of good government, as Cabinet has decided to progress the Bill despite it being a policy that is not evidence-based, has not been adequately tested, has not been consulted upon, and fails regulatory standards,” the Waitangi Tribunal said earlier.\n\nMaori groups take out “Hikoi” against Treaty Principles Bill\n\nNotably, approximately 10,000 protesters marched through Rotorua, New Zealand, voicing their opposition to the Treaty Principles Bill. As they made their way south towards the capital, Wellington, they were greeted by hundreds of supporters waving the Maori flag. The Hikoi (march in Maori language) is likely to reach Wellington on Tuesday, with participants staging rallies on their passage through towns and cities across the country. The Maori community, who make up 20% of New Zealand’s 5.3 million population, are opposed to the bill introduced by the ACT New Zealand Party, which they feel will lead to racial tensions and diminish Indigenous rights.\n\nMaori protestors carrying their traditional flag (Source: The Post)\n\nWhat the Treaty Principles Bill 2024 and its supporters say\n\nThe Treaty Principles Bill 2024 proposes extending the treaty to all New Zealanders through a referendum, but Maori leaders and activists argue that this will not only undermine Māori rights, but also promote anti-Māori discourse. The Bill is also unlikely to pass since ACT’s coalition partners, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s New Zealand National Party and the New Zealand First Party, have stated that they will oppose it in further readings despite their support in the first reading.\n\nThe Treaty of Waitangi remained in effect for 135 years until 1975, when the Labour government passed the Treaty of Waitangi Act. This Act indicated that the Treaty has principles, and it was the Waitangi Tribunal’s job to interpret them. The ACT argues that since the passage of the Waitangi Act 1975, the Tribunal, courts, and public service have over time expanded on the principles, however, the non-Maori New Zealanders have not been consulted on these principles.\n\n“The Treaty Principles Bill will not change the Treaty itself. That was set in 1840 and will remain forever. What we are seeking to do is continue the process of defining the Treaty principles, for the first time incorporating the voices of all people through a democratic Parliamentary process, instead of through the Tribunal or the courts,” ACT said.\n\nJust as the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi has three articles, the 2024 Treaty Principles Bill has three principles—Civil Government, Rights of Hapū and Iwi Māori and Right to Equality. “Civil government—the Government of New Zealand has full power to govern, and Parliament has full power to make laws. They do so in the best interests of everyone, and in accordance with the rule of law and the maintenance of a free and democratic society. Rights of hapū and iwi Māori—the Crown recognises the rights that hapū and iwi had when they signed the Treaty/te Tiriti. The Crown will respect and protect those rights. Those rights differ from the rights everyone has a reasonable expectation to enjoy only when they are specified in Treaty settlements. Right to equality—everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination. Everyone is entitled to the equal enjoyment of the same fundamental human rights without discrimination,” the Bill reads.\n\nThe three principles of the 2024 Treat Principles Bill (Source: Treaty.nz)\n\nTaking to X, ACT Party leader David Seymour who introduced the bill said that the Treaty of Waitangi promised “equality” and not “partnership”. He added that in the last elections, the people of New Zealand voted for stopping “divisive” policies like Three Waters, the Māori Health Authority, race-based waitlists, among others, with many of such policies being rolled back. However, Seymour raised concern that such policies favouring the Maori community could be brought back in the future if the 1840 Treaty’s principles were not clarified.\n\n“At the last election, Kiwis voted to stop divisive policies like co-governance, Three Waters, the Māori Health authority, race-based waitlists, and two different chief executives at every government department. We’re now winding these policies back, but all of this could be back with the stroke of a pen unless we clarify in law that the Treaty promised equality, not a partnership. Without clarified Treaty principles that write equal rights into law, Labour can – and will – use the idea that the Treaty is a partnership to advance divisive policies that make it harder for us to solve our shared problems in housing, education, health, and the cost of living,” Seymour said.\n\nAt the last election, Kiwis voted to stop divisive policies like co-governance, Three Waters, the Māori Health authority, race-based waitlists, and two different chief executives at every government department.\n\n\n\nWe’re now winding these policies back, but all of this could be back… — David Seymour (@dbseymour) November 18, 2024\n\nSeveral New Zealanders on X pointed out that the police were partaking in the Maori protest march and painting posters and banners.\n\nWtf!\n\nWith gang members attending the Hikoi at parliament tomorrow, what message does this send?\n\nHow can the public have any confidence that the Police are impartial when they are painting banners for the protest?\n\n\n\nDisgraceful.@MarkMitchellMP @actparty pic.twitter.com/61bvgTs8tx — Suit and tie (@Suitandtie9999) November 18, 2024\n\nIn another shocking incident, one of the Maori protestors snatched away the flag of New Zealand from a counter-protestor’s hand and tore it up.\n\nThese racial separatists are now confronting people who wave the New Zealand flag in public.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the @nzpolice did not intervene.#ToitūTeTiriti #maori #hikoi pic.twitter.com/4sOD2vLVFI — Kiwi BOSS (@KiwiLivesMatter) November 18, 2024\n\nThe Maori people and their popular Haka\n\nThe Māori tribes had settled in Polynesia and New Zealand after arriving in enormous canoes on the seas. Their culture exemplifies a strong connection to the earth and ancestral spirits. Te Reo Maori, the Māori language, remains central to the Maori identity and is widely spoken by the community. The Māori people have a deep spiritual connection to nature and the land and they refer to themselves as ‘kaitiaki’ or the guardians of the natural resources. Moreover, they believe in the notion of ‘whakapapa’, which states that everything in the world is interconnected and has a genealogical connection.\n\nThe haka is integral to Māori identity and is typically performed by warriors on the battlefield or to welcome new tribes. The “Haka” demonstrated athletic prowess while also representing cultural pride, strength, and unity. Apart from warfare, the haka was also used for storytelling, expressing communal grievances, celebrating victories, and honouring ancestors. The waiata (chants), transmit profound lessons about Maori culture, values, and connection to the land. Notably, the Haka is not one dance, but rather a type of performance. The Maori people perform various forms of Haka, including the popular Ka Mate, Haka pōwhiri, Haka taparahi, and Peruperu for varied purposes.\n\nWhile whether the Treaty Principles Bill 2024 gets passed and implemented or not remains to be seen, it has sparked a serious debate in the country with Maori people contending that their fight is to defend their culture from extinction on the other, the non-Maori New Zealanders feel that the Maori get several privileges and demand equality.",

		"title": "Christian conversions and Muslim infiltration threaten Jharkhand’s tribal identity",
		"text": "Amid the ongoing Jharkhand Assembly Elections 2024, the echoes of ‘roti’, ‘beti’, and ‘maati’ resonate strongly. Amidst these echoes, 8th November and 15th November (Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas) have also passed. The 8th of November is considered significant as it marks the first recorded instance of Christian conversion of tribal/Adivasi (Scheduled Tribes) individuals on this day in what is now Jharkhand.\n\nWhen and how did STs first convert to Christianity in Jharkhand?\n\nIn 1873, Archbishop Stains from Kolkata baptised 28 individuals from six Munda families in Khuntpani (also spelt Khutpani/Khuntpani). Khuntpani is now part of the West Singhbhum district in Jharkhand. A commemorative stone engraved with the names of these first converts still exists. To mark the day, a “pilgrimage fair” is organised annually on 8th November, attracting Christian converts from Jharkhand and neighbouring states in significant numbers. Roman Catholic devotees from foreign countries also visit the fair.\n\nSanthal Pargana – From the first Christian conversions to present-day Muslim infiltration\n\nKhuntpani is part of the Chotanagpur region, which has been significantly affected by the Christian missionary conversion mafia in Santhal Pargana. The influence is so pervasive that electing representatives from the ST community who have converted to Christianity has become common in the region.\n\nThe region is also under scrutiny for demographic changes caused by Bangladeshi-Rohingya Muslim infiltration. Sarna (tribal sacred sites) are vanishing, replaced by mosques and mazars. Tribals are losing not only their land and employment but also their daughters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed concern over these issues in many rallies.\n\nThe promise to curb infiltration and introduce the Sarna code\n\nIn light of this dire situation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pledged that if the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) gains power in the state, it will not only stop infiltration but also enact laws to reclaim land occupied or fraudulently acquired by infiltrators. Apart from infiltration, the Sarna Dharma Code has become a prominent issue in these elections.\n\nSource: OpIndia Hindi\n\nWhat is the Sarna Dharma Code?\n\nAs of now, Indian law recognises six religious communities: Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, and Jain. The Congress-HMM alliance, which denies concerns about infiltration, has promised to implement the Sarna Tribal Religious Code.\n\nIn November 2020, the INDIA coalition government convened a one-day special session of the Jharkhand Assembly to unanimously pass a proposal to include ‘Sarna’ as a separate religion in the 2021 Census. Despite questioning the government’s intentions, the BJP supported this proposal. Subsequently, Chief Minister Hemant Soren wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reiterating the demand.\n\nWhile releasing its manifesto for the Jharkhand elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stated that the BJP would consider the Sarna Code and make appropriate decisions. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the BJP’s election in-charge for Jharkhand, reiterated this stance on several occasions. Assam Chief Minister and election co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma went further, promising that the party would implement the Sarna Code if it forms the government.\n\nThe Sarna Code recognises tribal society as a distinct religious group. While the BJP has not publicly opposed it, its stance in this election appears softer compared to the RSS’s ideology, which considers tribal society part of Hinduism. The RSS, through organisations like the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, operates in tribal areas with this belief. Sandeep Oraon, regional coordinator (Bihar-Jharkhand) of the RSS-affiliated Tribal Security Forum, claims that implementing the Sarna Code would create several problems at various levels.\n\nThe Sarna Code will not address the issue of Christian conversion engulfing tribal society. From 1871 to 1951, tribal societies were recognised as a separate religious group in the Census, yet Christian conversions persisted, beginning in 1873 in Khuntpani, as discussed earlier.\n\nCan the Sarna Code counter Christian conversions?\n\nSimilar to Khuntpani, Madku Dweep in Chhattisgarh’s Mungeli district also hosts religious fairs promoting Christianity. Surrounded by the waters of the Shivnath River, the island is believed to be the site where Rishi Mandukya composed the ‘Mundaka Upanishad’, which inspired the motto ‘Satyamev Jayate’.\n\nReaching this island is challenging. In September 2022, I crossed the river by boat to visit it. However, I was shocked to see a platform with a cross on this deserted island. The largest annual gathering here is a week-long Christian fair held every February since 1909.\n\nKharkona’s story mirrors Khuntpani\n\nChhattisgarh’s Jashpur district is a major hub of Christian conversion activities. The country’s largest church is located in Kunkuri, within Jashpur district. The conversion of tribal society in this region began even when Sarna was recognised as a separate identity under British rule.\n\nIn the Manera block of Jashpur district lies a village called Kharkona. Upon entering the village, visitors are greeted by a Cross Square. A plaque near the church lists the names of 56 individuals baptised on 21st November 1906. In this village, I also visited ‘Sahib Kona’, which hosts annual events for converted Hindus.\n\nThe devastating impact of Christian conversion is evident in Jashpur. According to government records, one in every four people in the district identifies as Christian. This demographic shift occurred despite the significant influence of a royal family recognised for its efforts to counter missionary conspiracies and facilitate the return of converted Hindus (especially tribals) to their ancestral faith.\n\nClement Lakra’s 30-year fight for Sarna recognition\n\nThe fight for Sarna recognition predates the 24-year-old state of Jharkhand. It has spanned over 30 years, symbolised by the struggle of 58-year-old Clement Lakra. During my 2022 visit to Clement’s home in Duldula, Chhattisgarh, he shared:\n\n“My father was deceived. He was made a fool. The day I understood this, I lost my faith in Christianity. I vowed to reclaim the Sarna faith that they (the Catholic institution) desecrated and return to my ancestors’ religion. Let’s see how long I can fight them.”\n\nClement, a father of two daughters, resides in Duldula within Chhattisgarh’s Kunkuri Assembly constituency. His wife, Sushma Lakra, is the sarpanch of Duldula. Photographs on the walls of their home indicate the family had converted to Christianity, while documents scattered on a corner table narrate the hardships they endured post-conversion.\n\nClement’s approximately 10 acres of land is now occupied by a Catholic institution. This land houses a church, a school, residences for priests and nuns, and farmland cultivated by members of the institution. Clement’s father, Bhade alias Vashil Oraon, lost this land in exchange for converting to Christianity.\n\nDespite winning a legal battle against the Catholic institution, Clement has yet to reclaim the land. Instead, Catholic officials and their allies harass his family, obstructing development work in Duldula Panchayat. They have pressured his wife to convince Clement to withdraw the case. Recalling one incident, Clement said, “In February 2022, a meeting was held in the church. I was told that if I didn’t withdraw the case, I’d be ostracised from society. They even threatened that no one would marry my daughters.”\n\nChristian missionaries seize opportunities even in disasters\n\nAn organisation called Unfolding Word works on the mission of translating the Bible into every language. Its CEO, David Reeves, made shocking revelations in 2021. He disclosed that around 100,000 people were converted to Christianity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Each church was tasked with organising prayers in ten villages. During the pandemic, when physical gatherings were restricted, prayers were disseminated via phone calls and WhatsApp.\n\nAccording to Reeves, the number of churches built in India during the pandemic surpassed the total constructed in the preceding 25 years. One such church was observed in Jashpur’s Girang on forest department land. This church, constructed in an inaccessible area with no pathway, was eventually closed after protests halted its construction. Abhishek Gupta, affiliated with the BJP’s youth wing, told OpIndia, “Christian missionaries engage in land jihad in this manner. Wherever they find vacant land, they plant a cross and build a church. Over time, they conspire with the administration to construct access pathways, and soon prayers begin. Later, no matter how much one protests, the administration refuses to remove the encroachment.”\n\nThis church was being constructed during Covid-19 pandemic and the construction was stopped after protests. (Image: OpIndia Hindi)\n\nCan the Sarna Code stop the Joshua Project?\n\nThe Joshua Project, a US-based organisation established in 1995, claims to work under the biblical directive to convert and baptise people globally. According to reports, the organisation builds churches on tribal lands in states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. In 2011–12, these four states had approximately 12,000 churches, which have now grown to over 25,000. This expansion has occurred despite laws prohibiting outsiders from purchasing tribal land.\n\nAfter converting tribals to Christianity, missionaries often ask them to cut down Sarna trees, which hold sacred value for tribal communities. The impact of Christian conversions is so extensive that entire villages have been converted. In some cases, only a few Hindu families remain. Outside villages where missionaries have succeeded, crosses are erected as a symbol of dominance.\n\nWhen Christian population surpasses majority mark in any village, a cross like this gets placed in the village.\n\nThe Joshua Project’s activities extend beyond tribal communities. It has collected data on India’s 2,272 castes and tribes. The organisation reports that it has yet to reach 2,041 of these groups but has already influenced 103. Among these, some groups have seen significant Christian conversions, with 10%–100% of their populations converted in several cases.\n\n‘Roti-beti-maati’ and the BJP’s election campaign\n\nCentred around ‘roti-beti-maati’, the BJP has brought the dual threat of infiltrators and Christian missionaries to the forefront of its election campaign. Discussions now revolve around the legitimate and illegitimate methods used by churches to expand their presence across villages. To ensure that converted individuals from tribal communities retain their reservation benefits, many are being classified as crypto-Christians.\n\nEven the Madras High Court has flagged this issue. In a case involving Catholic priest George Ponnaiah from Kanyakumari, Justice G.R. Swaminathan noted significant demographic shifts in the region. Referring to Kanyakumari’s religious composition, the judge observed:\n\n“There has been a noticeable demographic shift in Kanyakumari’s religious composition. Since 1980, Hindus have ceased to be the majority in the district. However, the 2011 Census still identifies Hindus as the largest religious group at 48.5%, which might not reflect the ground reality. A significant number of Scheduled Castes have converted to Christianity but continue to identify as Hindus to retain reservation benefits.”\n\nThe need for political and societal action\n\nThis trap is not a recent phenomenon, nor is it limited to Jharkhand alone. It has deeper roots and a wider impact, threatening tribal and Hindu communities across India. While strict anti-conversion laws may act as a deterrent, they are not enough to counter this menace comprehensively. Hindu society cannot afford to remain complacent, relying solely on political parties, organisations, or a few families to fight against Christian missionaries.\n\nTo rescue Hindus from this vicious cycle, political and administrative willpower is crucial. Equally important is for every Hindu to remain aware and vocal about the demographic changes unfolding in their surroundings. Unfortunately, in independent India, neither politics has consistently demonstrated such resolve, nor has Hindu society compelled collective action on these issues.\n\nPolitical forces often exploit tribal identity issues, such as the Sarna Code, to divide Hindus while inadvertently aiding missionary activities. When the proposal to recognise Sarna as a separate religion was brought to the Jharkhand Assembly, the BJP expressed concerns about the potential divisions it could cause. Now, the BJP must focus on measures to counter missionary activities permanently.\n\nThe party needs to adopt the same level of aggression against Christian conversions as it demonstrates against infiltration. If this issue is not addressed promptly, the ongoing demographic battle will further weaken Hindus on the ground—weakening the foundation of the larger vision of ‘Akhand Bharat’.",

		"text": "Even as the Mahayuti alliance was charting a historic win in Maharashtra, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Northeast achieved an emphatic victory in the by-elections for eight Assembly seats on Saturday. The Congress party and its allies drew a blank in these bypolls.\n\nOf these 8 seats, five—Behali, Samaguri, Dholai, Bongaigaon, and Sidli—are located in Assam, two—Soreng-Chakung and Namchi-Singhithang—are in Sikkim, and one—Gambegre—is in Meghalaya. In Sikkim, the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) had already won the two seats unopposed.\n\nIn Assam, the BJP secured three seats, while its allies, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), won one seat each. Under the seat-sharing arrangement in Assam, the BJP contested from Behali, Samaguri, and Dholai, while the AGP and UPPL fielded candidates in Bongaigaon and Sidli, respectively.\n\nSamaguri, traditionally a Congress stronghold, was the only seat where the BJP faced significant uncertainty. However, BJP candidate Diplu Ranjan Sarmah defeated Congress’ Tanzil Hussain, son of Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain. The BJP retained Behali and Dholai and captured Samaguri from Congress. AGP and UPPL successfully defended their strongholds in Bongaigaon and Sidli.\n\nBesides, BJP’s Diganta Ghatowal defeated Congress’ Jayanta Borah in Behali, while Nihar Ranjan Das overcame Congress’ Dhrubajyoti Purkayastha in Dholai. In Bongaigaon, AGP’s Diptimoyee Choudhury, wife of Barpeta MP and AGP stalwart Phani Bhushan Choudhury, defeated Congress’ Brajenjit Singha. In Sidli, UPPL’s Nirmal Kumar Brahma bested Suddho Kumar Basumatary of the Bodoland People’s Front.\n\nIn Meghalaya, the ruling National People’s Party (NPP) candidate Dr Mehtab Chandee A Sangma, wife of Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma, won the Gambegre seat, defeating Trinamool Congress’ Sadhiarani M Sangma.",

I congratulate all the workers of BJP and NDA across the country,” PM Modi said addressing the party workers and leaders.\n\nHe lauded Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, state Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar for victory in Maharashtra polls.\n\nThe Prime Minister referred to the slogan ‘Ek hain toh safe hain’, raised by him during the assembly polls in Maharashtra and Jharkhand and said the biggest message of the polls is unity.\n\n“After Haryana, the biggest message of this election is unity. ‘Ek hain toh safe hain’ has become the ‘maha-mantra’ of the country,” he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also referred to the results of bypolls across 48 assemblies and two Lok Sabha seats in 15 states and said the BJP had increased its strength.\n\n“The results for byelections in several states were also declared today. Besides, our tally in Lok Sabha has increased today as well. UP, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan have strongly supported BJP (in bypolls). The people of Assam have once again expressed their trust in the BJP. We have also had success in Madhya Pradesh. Support for NDA has increased in Bihar. This shows that the country now only wants development,” he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister received a grand welcome as he arrived at the BJP headquarters and greeted party workers and leaders present there.\n\nAddressing the party workers, Union Minister and BJP chief JP Nadda termed the victory of Maharashtra assembly polls as “historic” and said that people have once again expressed their trust in the policies and development work of PM Modi.\n\n“Today is a historic day. The people of Maharashtra and the by-elections held in various states have shown that people have once again expressed their trust in the policies and development work of Prime Minister Modi,” Nadda said.\n\n“For some time now, the INDI alliance had the illusion that they would gain power by dividing people in the name of caste, constitution, and religion. Haryana, Maharashtra have given them an answer… In 2019, Uddhav Thackeray insulted the mandate, but today the people of Maharashtra have shown that they are with the Mahayuti, PM Modi,” he added.\n\nThe ruling Mahayuti alliance won the Maharashtra assembly polls and is poised for a landslide mandate. JMM-led alliance returned to power in Jharkhand.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the BJP led the Mahayuti alliance to a smashing victory carrying its allies – Shiv Sena and NCP – with its momentum.\n\nWhile the BJP has won or is ahead in 132 seats, Shiv Sena led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has won or is ahead in 57 seats and NCP led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is poised to win 41 seats. The state has 288 assembly seats.\n\nThe constituents of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered a rude jolt with Shiv Sena (UBT) led by Uddhav Thackeray poised to win 20 seats, Congress 16 and NCP(SP) led by Sharad Pawar only 10 seats.\n\nThe BJP saw a fabulous strike rate with the party poised to win 133 of 148 seats it contested in Maharashtra. Party’s allies Shiv Sena and NCP also have a very good strike rate.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Heartfelt gratitude to the people of Maharashtra for this historic mandate. By giving such a huge mandate to the Mahayuti alliance amidst illusion and lies, the people have closed the shops of those who are fake well-wishers of the Constitution.

In doing so, it has shut down the agendas of those who, under the guise of falsehoods and deception, claim to be the Constitution’s fake well-wishers.\n\nThis victory of the Mahayuti alliance is a testament to the ‘politics of performance’ under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, Shah added in a subsequent tweet, asserting that the people of Maharashtra have rejected the politics of appeasement and reaffirmed their trust in the legacy, development, and welfare initiatives of the Mahayuti alliance.\n\nEarlier today, the Mahayuti alliance in Maharashtra scripted a historic victory, returning to power by winning 231 seats in a 288-seat assembly and shaking off the disappointment it faced six months back in Maharashtra during the Lok Sabha elections.",

		"text": "On 23rd November, Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar) candidate and husband of Bollywood’s flop actress Swara Bhaskar, Fahad Ahmad, lost the Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024 from the Anushakti Nagar seat by a margin of over 3,300 votes to NCP (Ajit Pawar) candidate Sana Malik. Fahad was leading on the seat for a few rounds, but towards the end, he lost to Sana, leading to him appearing on camera and ranting against Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), claiming that on the machines where the battery was at 99%, Sana gained the lead.\n\nAfter round 16 and a steady lead in all rounds.. EVM machines that were 99% charged were opened and BJP supported NCP Ajit Pawar candidate took a lead .. @ECISVEEP @SpokespersonECI this is rank manipulation.

However, when the counting started on machines with a 99% battery, Sana Malik gained an “unexpected” lead.\n\nFahad raised questions about the authenticity of the EVM machines and vowed to write to the Election Commission for a recount. He said, “I hope the results will not be announced for the seat before the recounting is done.”\n\nSelf-proclaimed social activist Swara Bhaskar also joined her husband in the rant. In a post on X, she wrote, “In #AnushaktiNagar vidhaan sabha, after a steady lead by Fahad Ahmad of NCP-SP in rounds 17, 18, 19, suddenly 99%-battery-charged EVMs are opened, and the BJP-supported NCP-Ajit Pawar candidate takes the lead.

Election Commission has already debunked such claims last month after Congress raised suspecion of malpractice during elections. The Election Commission of India responded to the claims and dismissed them. Official sources of the ECI told the media that there is link between battery charge levels and voting numbers shown in EVMs. The officials explained that alkaline batteries are used in the Control Unit of the EMVs, and new batteries are inserted on the commissioning of the EVMs for the election in the presence of candidates or their agents, and then the machines are sealed.\n\nThe battery provides a voltage between 7.5 and 8 volts. When the voltage is above 7.4, the battery capacity is displayed as 99 per cent. As the battery charge is consumed with the use of the EVM for voting, the charge level is displayed as coming down gradually from 98% to 10%. The EVM works till the battery has over 5.8 volts. Before reaching 10% charge, the control unit starts displaying a low battery warning. The ECI further explained that the capacity of the battery on the counting day depends upon the mock poll conducted on the control unit, the actual poll and the initial voltage of the battery which can vary between 7.5 to 8 volts.",

Hence, there needs to be an appropriate order in this regard.“\n\nDevastating consequences await after Bangladesh High Court verdict on blasphemy law\n\nThe suggestion by the top court, which is likely to have far-reaching consequences, comes amid recent attacks on Hindus by Muslim mobs under the pretext of blasphemy.\n\nBangladesh had fallen into the hands of Islamists since the undemocratic ouster of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister. They want to penalise ‘blasphemy’ which concerns insult to Quran, Islam and Prophet Muhammad.\n\nMuslims in Bangladesh are known to evade prosecution under blasphemy laws, just like Pakistan, while the draconian legislation unilaterally targets Hindus and other religious minorities.\n\nCurrently, the maximum punishment imposed by the blasphemy law in Bangladesh is 2 years imprisonment and a fine of 5 lakh Taka.\n\nThe country’s High Court now recommends increasing the maximum punishment to non-bailable charge, life imprisonment and death penalty.\n\nMuslims attack Hindu minorities in Bangladesh under pretext of blasphemy\n\nIn October this year, a frenzied Muslim mob laid siege to the Kadirdi Degree College in Boalmari in the Faridpur district of Bangladesh after accusing a Hindu boy named Hridoy Pal of ‘insulting’ Prophet Muhammad.\n\nIn Faridpur, a teenager named Hriday Pal is being taken away by the army in a bizarre manner, but what is his crime?

		"text": "On 22nd November, students of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in Balahar, Pragpur, in Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, staged protests within the campus after a professor allegedly prohibited them from wearing tilak on their foreheads and chanting Jai Shri Ram. Earlier, the students submitted a written complaint to the director of the institute, Professor Satyam Kumari, who then referred the matter to a disciplinary committee for further investigation.\n\nAccording to the students, the professor allegedly stopped them from wearing tilak and raising ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans, claiming the slogan was political and discouraged its usage. The actions of the professor led to widespread discontent on the campus. The students also accused the professor of misbehaviour and discrimination.\n\nHindu organisations join the protests\n\nThe issue soon escalated beyond the campus as Hindu organisations were informed about the incident. Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal, and other Hindu groups such as Brahmin Sabha stepped in and staged protests at the main gate of the university. They chanted Jai Shri Ram and performed hymns in praise of Bhagwan Ram. They also met Professor Kumari to discuss the matter and demanded strict action against the accused professor.\n\nRashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan Director initiates investigation\n\nAddressing the controversy, Professor Kumari said, “The students’ complaint has been received, and a disciplinary committee has been formed. Both the professor and the students have been asked to present their statements to the committee. A notice has already been issued to the professor.” Furthermore, she assured that the matter would be resolved soon and attributed the situation to a possible misunderstanding. The disciplinary committee is expected to submit its findings shortly.\n\nVHP calls for action, vows continued support\n\nLeaders of Hindu Jagram Manch also arrived at the campus of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and supported the protesting students. Speaking on the matter, VHP activists criticised the actions of the professor and asserted that they hurt Hindu sentiments. A VHP member said, “We will not tolerate any suppression of our religious rights.”\n\nMeanwhile, students demanded disciplinary action and warned that they would continue protests if their concerns were not addressed. The director has appealed for calm, assuring all parties that a fair investigation will be conducted to address the grievances.",

		"title": "Canada says no evidence to link PM Modi to Khalistani Nijjar's murder",
		"text": "On 21st November (local time), the Canadian government dismissed a media report that linked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to criminal activities in Canada, including the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nIn a statement, the National Security and Intelligence Adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister, Nathalie G. Drouin, termed the report “speculative and inaccurate.” The Indian Ministry of External Affairs had already dismissed the report, calling it a “smear campaign.”\n\nThe response came after a 19th November report in The Globe and Mail newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior national security adviser, claimed that Canadian security agencies believed PM Modi was aware of the so-called plot to kill terrorist Nijjar. The report further alleged that Canadian and American intelligence tied the assassination operations to Home Minister Amit Shah, claiming that Doval and Jaishankar were also involved.\n\nCalling the report inaccurate in a statement issued by the Privy Council Office on 21st November, Drouin said, “On October 14, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India.”\n\nShe added, “The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of, evidence linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate.”\n\nIndia refuted The Globe and Mail report\n\nResponding to The Globe and Mail report, the MEA called it a “smear campaign” and said, “We do not normally comment on media reports. However, such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties.”\n\nOur response to queries regarding a report in Canadian media: https://t.co/1IAURpKlfT pic.twitter.com/jIPlg05JM6 — Randhir Jaiswal (@MEAIndia) November 20, 2024\n\nOn 19th November, The Globe and Mail claimed that Canadian security agencies suspected PM Modi was aware of plans linked to the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. The newspaper further added that there was no direct evidence confirming PM Modi’s involvement. It further noted that intelligence assessments implicated Home Minister Amit Shah, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in these actions, raising concerns about India’s foreign interference in Canada.\n\nCanada accused Indian agents, diplomats, and HM Shah of criminal activities\n\nThe statement by the Canadian government comes over a month after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Mike Duheme accused Indian officials, diplomats, and “agents” of criminal activities on Canadian soil. During a press conference, the RCMP claimed that India had been targeting pro-Khalistani elements in Canada and not the entire Sikh community, indirectly acknowledging that Canada has been sheltering Khalistani terrorists and pro-Khalistani elements.\n\nHours after the RCMP’s statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he believed India had made a “monumental mistake by choosing to use their diplomats and organised crime to attack Canadians.”\n\nThe changing tunes of Canada\n\nThe diplomatic relations between India and Canada have been strained for a while. They worsened in September 2023 when the Canadian Prime Minister accused India of involvement in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar during a statement in the Canadian Parliament. India immediately refuted the claims. However, the accusations led to the expulsion of Indian diplomats, and India retaliated by expelling Canadian diplomats. In October, India further asked around 40 Canadian diplomats to leave the country.\n\nIndia also accused Canada of being a safe haven for gangsters, terrorists, and criminals, a claim supported by the fact that several wanted Indian criminals are living safely in Canada. India has requested the extradition of several wanted criminals, but Canada has bluntly refused to comply, including in the case of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nCanada has been changing its stance repeatedly. Initially, it claimed Indian agents were involved in criminal activities. Then, when India asked for substantial evidence, Canada could not provide it. It has been over a year since Canada accused India of killing a Khalistani terrorist on Canadian soil but has yet to provide any evidence that India could follow up on or use to initiate an investigation. Furthermore, Canada has been making it difficult for Indian diplomats to perform their duties. Recently, Indian consulate was forced to cancel camps after Trudeau govt did not provide even ‘minimum security’.\n\nIn a statement, the Indian consulate stated, “Due to continued inability conveyed by security agencies to provide minimum security against heightened threats, Consulate has had to cancel some more consular camps. Most of them were not at any places of worship, including one at a Police facility.”\n\nIt further added, “Consulate is fully sensitive to the difficulties faced by close to 4,000 elderly members of the diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area- both Indian and Canadian nationals- who have been deprived of an essential consular service.”\n\nFurthermore, Canada is expected to have general elections in October 2025. Sikh votes are crucial for Justin Trudeau to return to power. It appears that he is wooing pro-Khalistani elements by siding with them and acting against India for political gains, which is harming relations between the two countries.",

		"title": "Dalit Lekhraj’s daughter becomes Sakina: Over 3000 non-Muslims studying in a madarasa in Rajasthan, reveals RTI; Bajrang Dal alleges conversion conspiracy",
		"text": "In Rajasthan, a conspiracy has been going to convert Dalit Hindu children to Islam through madarsas. Hindu rights group Bajrang Dal and an RTI activist have alleged that Hindu children are being brainwashed through Islamic education.\n\nAccording to the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu Dalit girl’s name was recently registered at the madrasa as Sakina even though her father is a Hindu. The Bajrang Dal alleged that six Hindu students were converted to Islam at the same madrasa. Following this case, an RTI surfaced, raising further questions.\n\nThe RTI has found that around 3000 non-Muslim children are studying in Rajasthan madrasas and a significant number of these children are said to be Hindu. Girls account for over half of all students who attend madrasas rather than government or private schools.\n\nThe RTI report revealed that the number of non-Muslim students in these madrasas is in the hundreds but the number of non-Muslim teachers is negligible. In this case, RTI activists and people of Bajrang Dal have pointed towards a big conspiracy of conversion and brainwashing the Hindu students into following Islamic traditions.\n\nHow the conversion conspiracy was exposed?\n\nRajasthan High Court lawyer Sujit Swami had filed an RTI to the Rajasthan Madarsa Board. In this, he had asked how many non-Muslim students are studying in the madrasas of all the districts within Rajasthan. In addition, Swami also sought information about how many non-Muslim teachers are there in the madarsas in Rajasthan. Subsequently, the Madarsa Board provided him with district-wise data on non-Muslim madrasa teachers. OpIndia has seen the RTI findings. Meanwhile, Bajrang Dal and Sujit Swami have raised some serious questions about the issue.\n\nWhat information came out?\n\nRajasthan Madarsa Board has informed that a total of 3056 non-Muslim students are getting education in the madrasas of the state in the academic session 2024-25. Of these, 1600 are boys while 1456 are girls and the largest number of non-Muslim students studying in madarsas are in the Kota district. 184 girls and 156 boys are studying in Kota. After this, 161 non-Muslim boys and 147 girls are studying in madarsas in the Tonk district. 115 non-Muslim boys and 98 girls are studying in Chittorgarh.\n\nNon-Muslim students are acceptable, teachers are not?\n\nThe alarming fact revealed by this RTI is that, while there are thousands of non-Muslim pupils learning in madrasas, there are almost no non-Muslim teachers. In Kota, where the majority of non-Muslim children attend madrasas, there is only one non-Muslim teacher. The surprising fact revealed by the RTI is that in 15 of Rajasthan’s 33 districts, there are no non-Muslim female madrasa teachers.\n\n\n\nThe remaining ten districts have only one non-Muslim female teacher. Similarly, some districts have no or only one non-Muslim male teacher. The number of non-Muslim students in thousands and the number of teachers not even in double digits is raising many questions. A total of 261 non-Muslim teachers are teaching in madrasas in the whole of Rajasthan. Among these non-Muslim male teachers, 170 are in just 10 districts.\n\nSpeaking to OpIndia, Sujit Swami said, “It is unusual for non-Muslim students to study in madrasas because in most places there are government schools as well. Many of the madrasas where these students are studying are running in mosques. Namaaz is also offered in these madrasas. Even if the madrasas run by them claim that non-Muslim children are not given Islamic education, are you not creating separate classes for them? In such a situation, what is the guarantee that they will not be brainwashed? Then if this is the case, then why are there fewer non-Muslim teachers?”\n\nStudent’s name is Sakina, father’s name is Lekhraj, what is the matter?\n\nBajrang Dal said that a Dalit girl studying in Madrasa Darul Uloom Tehreek-e-Hind in Anantapur, Kota was found to be named Sakina. In this case, Yogesh Renewaal of Bajrang Dal said, “Sakina belongs to the Bairwa community, who are Dalits. Sakina’s family is also poor, her father Lekhraj earns a living for the family by doing hard labour. He does not know this madrasa and its activities. Sakina earlier also studied in a school run by a Muslim. She was later admitted to the madrasa.”\n\n“Sakina’s case is not the only one, there are 6 such students in this madrasa. We demand that a serious investigation be conducted. The girl’s family is poor and we suspect that she has been taken into confidence to be sent to school either on the pretext of financial help or a good education. Mostly Dalit and poor families are targeted. We had also complained to the district administration in this matter but then these madrasa people did not even pick up the phone. Some officers of the district administration are also protecting them,” Renewaal further alleged.\n\nAccording to a document from Anantpura Madrasa, two children who are learning here have Islamic names, although their father’s name is Abhishek Khan. Yogesh Renewal stated that this automatically raises questions. He stated that if an objective inquiry is undertaken in this matter, numerous irregularities will be revealed. Sujit Swami has urged that a special probe be performed in Kota because it has the highest number of non-Muslim children.\n\nAllegations were levelled against the District Minority Welfare Officer\n\nYogesh Renewal has also made allegations against Kota District Minority Welfare Officer Naheeda Khan. He said that whenever it comes to irregularities in madrasas, Naheeda protects them. It is worth noting that Naheeda Khan had put up a status regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict in October 2023. Khan had posted a status on her social media, praying for Gaza, boycotting several companies, and also asking for support and donations. A complaint was lodged against her for this. She clarified that this status was posted by her 8-year-old son and a notice was also sent to her in this matter.\n\nNCPCR raised the issue earlier\n\nThis is not the first time that questions have been raised about non-Muslim students studying in madrasas. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has been raising the issue of Islamic education given in these madrasas and its non-Muslim children. In one such case, NCPCR chief Priyank Kanungo had said that a Hindu child was circumcised in a madrasa in Saharanpur. Before this, he had also raised questions about the curriculum of other madrasas, in which Hindus were declared ‘ Mushrik’ and ‘Kafir’.\n\nOpIndia tried to contact Kota MLA and Education Minister Madan Dilawar regarding the issue of non-Muslim children studying in madrasas in Rajasthan and the impact of this education on them. However, due to his busy schedule, the conversation could not take place. OpIndia also tried to contact Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Premchand Bairwa, who belongs to the Bairwa community, however, we have yet to receive a response from him. This report will be updated when the Education Minister or Deputy Chief Minister responds to the matter.",

		"title": "Rahul Gandhi article 'a new deal for Indian business' is an attempt to fool people: Here is why",
		"text": "Rahul Gandhi has recently written an article for a newspaper about his “new deal” for Indian business and also a video about how he is not “anti-business” but only anti-monopoly”.\n\nChoose your India:\n\n\n\nPlay-Fair or Monopoly?\n\nJobs or Oligarchies?\n\nCompetence or Connections?\n\nInnovation or Intimidation?\n\nWealth for many or the few?\n\n\n\nI write on why a New Deal for Business isn't just an option. It is India's future. pic.twitter.com/sGbC89ZFMF — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) November 6, 2024\n\nWhile this may seem like a positive development, given his vitriolic attacks on Indian businesses especially ones engaged in infrastructure and other businesses with long cycles, there are more than enough reasons to be sceptical.\n\nLet us go into the details.\n\nFirst, the article for Indian Express. Astute observers like Padmaja have alleged that the article is plagiarised from Edmund Burke’s paper for Cambridge, enhanced with some AI masala.\n\nThis is Plagiarism, just read two lines and realized this article is a smartly copied view of Chapter 13—Edmond Burke on India -published online by Cambridge University Press on 05 December 2012 and later improved by one of the AI platforms. There is no need to read further.… — Padmaja 🇮🇳 (@prettypadmaja) November 6, 2024\n\nThere were several high-profile reactions to the allegation as well.\n\nWould be interesting to see original copy of chapter 13 in Edmond Burke’s 2012 work from which @RahulGandhi’s op-ed is allegedly plagiarised. If so, editors at @IndianExpress have very poor ability to spot plagiarism. So too Rahul’s PR-edit team whose bright idea this was. https://t.co/dE3moO0Hpj — Minhaz Merchant (@MinhazMerchant) November 7, 2024\n\nIn any case, it is quite likely ghost-written by some Palazzo serf. After all, the Crown Prince has in the past been photographed copying a simple obituary message from his mobile phone! His intellectual power is the stuff of WhatsApp jokes and memes.\n\nLet us set aside the plagiarism part – frankly, I have not read the Burke article and I cannot confirm. In any case, what matters is what he is saying. Ghostwriting is also not uncommon among political leaders, let us skip that too. To be fair, he won’t be the first or only one and it is OK as leaders use aides and experts to write stuff. In a way that is better than spouting his own nonsense.\n\nI’m not even going into the issue of an entitled dynast from a family that monopolised power and privilege and wants to continue to do so in perpetuity, using a corrupt feudal ecosystem of media coolies, talking like a saint about monopoly. Let’s give him a free pass on that.\n\nThe gist of that article is that he links East India Company’s colonial loot with modern monopolies and offers us a “new deal” for “progressive” businesses. Bizarrely he lists Bajaj Auto among the companies that have “innovated” and “played by rules” in contrast with the “monopolies”. Ask your father or grandpa who had to wait years for a scooter that didn’t change much for years when Bajaj was the only game in town during the dynasty era! Small mercy he did not list Ambassador Car or Hindustan Motors, guess he too is clever enough to know they are out of business since the competition arrived.\n\nThe article was followed by a media campaign by the usual serfs to sell the article and its alleged author as some revolutionary that has come to clean up the Indian economy. It is amazing to watch the low bar the Darbari media ecosystem sets for the shehzada. Presumably, they think he is a dimwit so even putting out this article is a great sign of intellectual maturity and sagacity.\n\nRajdeep Sardesai immediately declared it a “model” and wanted a debate with the Modi model! Is writing an article, plagiarised or otherwise, for a newspaper or portal a “model”?!\n\nStory that caught the eye: @RahulGandhi writes an op-ed in @IndianExpress to expand on his ‘New Deal’ views on big business and his stand against monopolistic tendencies. Maybe we should have a debate between the Rahul and Modi model of doing business in India? pic.twitter.com/ZLo1Y2j8JJ — Rajdeep Sardesai (@sardesairajdeep) November 6, 2024\n\nShall we debate the “Ganesh model” then?! Rajdeep had no guts to question why that “model” was not implemented in states ruled by Congress or the nation when it had ample time to do so. After all, not just Bajaj and Ambassador, numerous other monopolies flourished in the dynastic loot era in a mutually convenient neta-babu-lala ecosystem. More on that later.\n\nAs if that article were not revolutionary enough he followed up with a short video on X where he declared he is not anti-business.\n\nNow let us get to the meat of this article! Is this a sign of big change? Should we be fooled again?\n\nGood news first – the very fact that he writes such articles and posts such videos is a sign of progress. He has not bothered all these years while spewing venom against businesses that takes us right back to the Nehru-Indira era of socialism. Clearly someone with brains is telling him – enough is enough and he should present himself as a PM role aspirant not some Maoist NGO activist. Small though the mercy is, it is to be welcomed.\n\nAfter all, we know that Nehru-Indira socialism was just a facade for rent-seeking politicians, corrupt babus and crooked businessmen to continue to enjoy monopoly, producing the same product for decades without innovation, preventing entry of newcomers and imports. It was justified with grandiose statements of ideology and subaltern politics. Corrupt leftist academia/media ecosystem, in exchange for table scraps of loot, favours and gigs, sang praise of this system while the rest of India withered away or ran abroad. We saw countries like Indonesia or Malaysia that did not have this burden race ahead.\n\nEven Modi Sarkar couldn’t completely take down this edifice of babudom because it is so well entrenched in years of dynastic loot rule. Every step forward he takes, he must face the entire ecosystem hollering blue murder, planting articles in the media. Like Congress forced to use ‘soft Hindutva’, Modi has also been forced to use ‘soft reforms’.\n\nBut there are more than enough reasons to be sceptical about this change if it is indeed one. Like his embrace of OBC politics and his sudden love for the constitution (or a red book with blank pages), this too could be a too-clever-by-half trick simply to get back to power again in Delhi so damaadshri can get back to his good old days.\n\nHe has not repudiated the neta-babu-lala ecosystem that Congress empowered, which resulted in exploitative monopolies and miserable products and services for consumers. He tried to go back to the colonial era to seek contrast when something much more recent was readily available. He has not disassociated himself from the JNU Maoist cabal that has infested his inner circle nor has he reduced the role of Jairam Ramesh and other practically-commie advisors and sycophants. Needless to say, he has not withdrawn from the INDI alliance that includes the CPM and other fringe left parties. He has not denounced or distanced from the Soros ecosystem that funds fringe left and other destructive outfits. He has not instructed his serfs like Jairam Iyengar to stop attacking Indian businesses trying to gain foothold abroad – instead they are attacking them non-stop. On the contrary, Macron, Biden, Xi or any other leader supports, even actively lobbies for their country’s business. No one believes the “oh we are only opposed to big business exploitation” story – petty traders or factory owners can’t set up ports or railways abroad. ALL business is for profit & therefore exploitative in leftist jargon. Boeing, Hitachi, Rafale, Adani, Huawei, Thales, Airbus – you name it, they are all the same and work for maximising profits. They get support from their governments. Not sabotage. His own CMs are ignoring his vitriolic rhetoric and signing up for deals and even photo-ops with the very same moneybags he is demonising. Rahul is simply trying to make a virtue out of a humiliating reality. His assurance in the article that even the monopolists shouldn’t be “in fear” seems like a pitch for donation or buying him off. After all that’s how Indian politics worked long before Modi or BJP. Yet another push factor is that the old class war tactics and pitting Indians against Indian business is no longer a saleable. It worked for Indira G but not now. People, whether they are employed or jobless, have come to realise that investments bring jobs. And private businesses, not Soros or NGOs invest. They are not fooled by anti-business rhetoric of corrupt dynasts they suspect are on the rolls of the same moneybags. Again, dimwit shehzada belatedly realises he is stuck in rut of the 1950s and his voters have moved on. Let us not make a virtue of it.\n\nSo what will convince me and in my opinion, others like me that want to see India move away from decades of socialism and sloth, find it’s place in the world?\n\nI want Rahul and Congress to completely rid themselves of Aiyars, Jairams and other JNU Maoist ideological waste that Deng flushed away – tell them to go join the CPM where at least they are honest about their plank and ideology. I want Rahul to apologise for his past track record and that of his granny’s and stop demonising Indian business. He is free to point out specific charges of corruption but only if he has evidence – not empty words and rhetoric. I want Rahul to speak on economic matters from the right – take on Nirmala Sitharaman and her MCA/IT babus and challenge them to de-regulate, simplify and reduce the burden of compliance, be it on GST, IT, Corporate laws or whatever. I want Rahul to speak about nonsensical rules and taxes like TCS – I want him to question why it took 11 years to get rid of angel tax terror and ask when the rest of the monstrosities will go. I want him to stand up for Indians facing up to babudom in their daily lives as businesses or individuals. Babudom, that is a direct product of 50 years of his family rule. I want him to DEMAND, not OPPOSE, outside talent in bureaucracy and government. Stop the hypocrisy – MMS was one, so was Rajan! One is Khatri Sikh the other Tambram. Best way to help OBC and Dalits is create an economy that’s firing on all cylinders using best available talent. I want Rahul to instruct his CMs to cooperate on GST reform – not just talk one thing in public and another in council meetings. Did any suggest simplified unitary rate that her talks loose about, put it to vote? We are not fools. I want to see Rahul attacking Modi for NOT doing enough to help our businesses conquer distant markets – not the reverse. I want Rahul’s advisors not to waste time ghostwriting articles, plagiarised or not. Instead draft a simple, beautiful IT Act or Companies Act and dare the Modi sarkar to pass it! Introduce the bill – you have enough talent and expertise. Then demand credit, you will get it!\n\nDo this and more along these lines, Rahulji, you will have more of the young, educated, aspirational class of Indians supporting you. If not you are only left with sycophants like Rajdeeps, Sharmas, Banerjees and Pandey’s trying to sing songs.\n\nIf I have not said this before, let me end this by saying it again – we are not fools. We have seen thru your nautankis and empty words. Three times.",

		"title": "'Ranting Gola' issues bizarre apology after her video calling Abu Azmi a corrupt politician goes viral, netizens ask if all her videos are 'scripted'",
		"text": "On the 19th of November, a video of Modi-BJP detractor Shamita Yadav aka “Ranting Gola”, ‘ranting’ against Abu Azmi, the Samajwadi Party MLA from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar in Maharastra, went viral on social media. However, soon after, Shamita Yadav published a video claiming that her ranting video against Abu Azmi was based on a script and only for trial and she had not shared it anywhere.\n\nIn the viral video, Shamita Yadav said that despite being a three-term MLA Abu Azmi has failed to raise the issue of rampant illegal drugs sales in Govandi.\n\n“Since the last 15 years, there has been an increase in drugs problem in Govandi but there is one more thing common in the last 15 years, Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi. In the last 15 years he has not even written a single letter to the police to take action against drugs abuse. You have only one job, if you can’t even do that, why don’t you just leave the chair,” she said.\n\nFurthermore, Yadav accused Abu Azmi of either making money from the drug business or himself running the nexus and said, “In a place where young people are being killed due to drugs, from 2009 to 2021, you (Abu Azmi) have got only 2 cases registered in the NDPC [it is Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, or simply NDPS Act]. You are either getting your Kharcha Paani or you are running this drugs business. You Nithallay [useless] MLA, in your Govandi, the average age of people in Govandi is just 36 years. Entire Mumbai’s bio-medical waste is burnt here, the smoke of SMS company has made it difficult to breathe, and a maximum number of TB patients in Mumbai are from here. So in the next batch of biomedical waste, get your shame also set ablaze.”\n\nThe “Ranting Gola” went on to slam the Samajwadi Party leader for allegedly muzzling the voices of those criticising him by filing false cases against them. “[You are] on top in Gundagardi, crime and if some social activist speaks up against you, then you file bogus cases against them. At least stop encroaching on the library. A leech-like yourself has not even spared the soil of graveyard. Why is there, not a single college or hospital constructed, did you shove all the official funds in your backside,” Yadav said and concluded her ‘rant’ with an appeal to the people of Govandi to vote for themselves and their issues instead of voting to make a candidate win.\n\nShocking to see such views of @therantinggola about Shri Abu Azmi Ji.\n\n\n\nPlz don’t share this and Rt. 😔 pic.twitter.com/hkUBGou3Lp — Sunny (@being_sunny1) November 20, 2024\n\nAs the video went viral on social media in no time, Shamita Yadav quickly published a video giving ‘clarification’ that the content of her rant against Abu Azmi was merely a “script provided to her” and that she had not verified the script. In addition, she said that it was made as a trial video and was not meant to be publicly released.\n\n“Everyone must have seen that a video of mine against Abu Asim Azmi is going viral. I just want to clarify that this video is not verified by me. I was only given a script and was asked for a trial recording. This video was never made for public release. That is why you all must have noticed that this video was not uploaded by me on any of my social media handles. So I just want to tell you all that it is only a script and a trial recording and should be taken as that only. This video neither contains my personal viewpoints nor information verified by me…” Yadav said.\n\nAAP Chronology samajhiye :\n\n\n\n👉She got the script from Congress\n\n\n\n👉Gola Made the ranting draft video\n\n\n\n👉Congress released the video without paying her for her ranting\n\n\n\n👉she now left clarifying her stand\n\n\n\nThese people can do anything for money\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/x1cfTnZiL0 — Rishi Bagree (@rishibagree) November 20, 2024\n\nGiven that Shamita Yadav is notorious for her annoying haranguing against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP-RSS and its supporters, her rant against the Samajwadi Party MLA came as a surprise for many on social media. However, as Shamita Yadav aka Ranting Gola published a ‘clarification’ video over her rant against Abu Azmi, many raised questions about her conduct and questioned if her ‘rant’ videos, often seen as political activism, are actually just ‘scripts that she reads from?’\n\nPopular X user “The Hawk Eye” shared the viral video and said: “This is liberal’s darling, you-go-gal, more-pawa-to-u @therantinggola. Paw paw ne paise bhi ni diye aur @abuasimazmi se pangey alag.”\n\nThis is liberal's darling, you-go-gal, more-pawa-to-u @therantinggola.\n\n\n\nPaw paw ne paise bhi ni diye aur @abuasimazmi se pangey alag🤣🤌🏼 pic.twitter.com/Kw9z63NqcX — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) November 20, 2024\n\nAnother X user “Raja Babu” said: “When you don’t get money after promoting a movie”.\n\nOne X user named Mikku said: “This krantikari social activist used to label BJP leaders as ‘gundas’ but a single call from Abu Azmi made her realize who the real ‘gunda’ is. In this video you hear her saying “You file fake cases against activists opposing you” and she’s now apologizing for the same video.”\n\nThis krantikari social activist used to label BJP leaders as ‘gundas’ but a single call from Abu Azmi made her realize who the real 'gunda' is.\n\n\n\nIn this video you hear her saying “You file fake cases against activists opposing you” and she's now apologizing for the same video. 🤣 pic.twitter.com/dxGnuacdvL — Mikku 🐼 (@effucktivehumor) November 20, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, “Incognito” said: “Ranting Gola is crying because her “scripted” video about Abu Azmi which was not meant for “public release” is now going viral. Lagta hai payment ruk gai.”\n\nRanting Gola is crying because her \"scripted\" video about Abu Azmi which was not meant for \"public release\" is now going viral.\n\n\n\nLagta hai payment ruk gai 😭😭 pic.twitter.com/CkIUfzUYJq — Incognito (@Incognito_qfs) November 20, 2024\n\nAlthough, “Ranting Gola” issued a ‘clarification’ that it was a script and that she was asked to make a trial recording, she did not elaborate on who provided her with the script or sought a trial recording. Was it her team? Or someone, possibly Abu Azmi’s political opponents wanted Shamita Yadav to make a video targeting Abu Azmi for money? While the real reason for Yadav’s backtracking on her rant against the Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar MLA remains best known to her, it is obvious to speculate that the supporters of Abu Azmi may have criticised her, or maybe she did not receive the desired payment for the video in question.\n\nAlso, it raises the question of whether Shamita Yadav has turned ‘ranting’ into her full-fledged profession since her own admission in the ‘clarification’ video suggests that she is provided with scripts on various topics by someone else, that script is prepared by someone else and she ‘verifies’ the facts of the script perhaps only after receiving payment? Or maybe it is all a warp and weft of lies to escape threats and trolling from the Samajwadi Party leader and even avoid chances of having false cases filed against her by Azmi, as she claimed in her ‘scripted’ video that Abu Azmi files bogus cases against his critics to silence them.\n\nApart from the hilarity of this episode, it is evident that ranting against Prime Minister Narendra Modi is easier and safer in India than criticising any anti-BJP politician. Much like numerous other left-liberal ‘influencers’, “Ranting Gola” has also earned popularity within the Islamo-leftist ecosystem by slandering PM Modi and selectively targeting the BJP without facing any legal consequences or threats. However, one single video criticising the Samajwadi Party leader who is not even in a ruling government anywhere, forced her to issue ‘clarification’ distancing herself from her own comments and passing it off as ‘script’. This incident raises questions if most of the videos of Ranting Gola if not all, are purely propaganda ‘rants’ funded by certain individuals or political outfits against their nemesis.",

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vinod Tawde has been accused by the opposition of giving money to people, however, he dismissed the claims later. Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule, leader of The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)- Sharad Pawar faction which is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has also been charged with embezzling Bitcoin scam funds.\n\nMeanwhile, India Today ‘journalist’ Rajdeep Sardesai has once again taken a biased stance over the two issues. Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) members in Palghar, Maharashtra, accused BJP National General Secretary Vinod Tawde on 19th November of distributing money to voters. Afterward, Rajdeep Sardesai made several tweets regarding the issue which is a matter of investigation, and kept highlighting the issue.\n\n“Huge: A day before Maharashtra goes to polls, major controversy. BJP national general secretary Vinod Tawde trapped and gheraoed by a BVA MLA in a hotel in Virar, accused of having a Rs 5 crores cash bag with a diary of people to whom money given is reportedly mentioned. BJP and BVA activists clash. Money power in this Maharashtra election is worst kept secret. How can elections be free and fair if votes are ‘bought’? Will Election Commission of India investigate, act or stay quiet once again,” he stated in a tweet.\n\nHe then made another tweet about the three First Information Reports (FIRs) submitted in “cash for votes” issue at Tulinj police station. He wrote, “BJP candidate named in two FIRs. Vinod Tawde named in one FIR. BVA also named in one FIR. Total cash found 9 lakhs 53 thousand 900 rupees. 9,53,900 total cash seized by election officials.” The FIRs are filed over “illegal campaigning under 48 hours before voting, cash seized and illegal press conference by both sides.”\n\nBreaking: Total three FIR filed in Maharashtra cash for votes matter. BJP candidate named in two FIRs. Vinod Tawde named in one FIR. BVA also named in one FIR.\n\nTotal cash found 9 lakhs 53 thousand 900 rupees.\n\n9,53,900 total cash seized by election officials.\n\nTotal three FIRs… — Rajdeep Sardesai (@sardesairajdeep) November 19, 2024\n\nDownplaying the allegations against Supriya Sule he remarked. “Criminal and defamation case after purported audio clip of her claiming to seek Bitcoin funds for election campaign goes viral. Interesting that allegation was made by BJP within hours of the cash for votes allegations involving its senior leader Vinod Tawde became the big story. Even more intriguingly, the person who made the allegations had spent several months in jail. Maharashtra political drama needs an OTT serial to expose all the muck.”\n\nMaharashtra politics gets murkier by the hour: @supriya_sule files criminal and defamation case after purported audio clip of her claiming to seek Bitcoin funds for election campaign goes viral. Interesting that allegation was made by BJP within hours of the cash for votes… — Rajdeep Sardesai (@sardesairajdeep) November 20, 2024\n\nRajdeep Sardesai was providing up-to-date information on Vinod Tawde. Now, anyone can argue that Rajdeep Sardesai is a journalist, so what’s wrong if he’s tweeting over the matter? However, there is a problem. While Vinod Tawde was accused, Sharad Pawar’s MP daughter Supriya Sule was also accused of using the money from the bitcoin scam in the assembly elections and the BJP also raised the issue. However, Rajdeep Sardesai did not tweet even once about the allegations against her. The one who accused her is a retired IPS officer. An audio of a conversation has also surfaced, with some alleging that the voice is Sule’s. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar also confirmed that he recognized the voice of his cousin Supriya Sule and it was her on the audio clip.\n\nRajdeep Sardesai while amplifying the allegations against Tawde, actively downplayed the allegations against Sule. A popular handle on X named ‘Eminent Intellectual’ asked if the cause behind the bias is the bond between Sharad Pawar and Rajdeep Sardesai’s father, Dilip Sardesai. The journalist is still repaying Sharad Pawar for a favor he did for his father, the handle suggested.\n\n🚨 In October 93, Rajdeep Sardesai's father was arrested for huge money laundering. The CM of Maharashtra was Sharad Pawar. So the case just disappeared.\n\n\n\nNov 24, #RajdeepSarDesai makes multiple tweets about allegations against #VinodTawade but forgets to mention 100 times more… pic.twitter.com/oQzm23IhUr — Eminent Intellectual (@total_woke_) November 20, 2024\n\nThe handle named Eminent Intellectual on social media site X has revealed that in October 1993, Dilip Sardesai, the cricketer was arrested on charges of money laundering. Sharad Pawar was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra at that time. Eventually, this case completely disappeared. Maybe this explains why Rajdeep Sardesai still feels grateful to Sharad Pawar. On 20th October 1993, it was announced that Dilip Sardesai and Jayant Vittaldas, a businessman from Pune, had been detained in connection with a money laundering case involving 6.89 million US dollars (about Rs 58 crore in today’s currency) and placed in judicial custody until 29th October. The arrest took place after the Income Tax raid at Vittaldas’ place.\n\nHowever, no one knows what happened later. With Sharad Pawar’s grace, Dilip Sardesai reportedly emerged unscathed. Maybe this explains why Rajdeep Sardesai continues to benefit from Sharad Pawar’s generosity and is paying him back by not tweeting on the allegations against his daughter.",

		"title": "Supriya Sule, Nana Patole used Bitcoin scam cash to fund Maharashtra polls, claims former IPS Ravindranath Patil",
		"text": "A day before the state of Maharashtra goes to the polls, Ravindranath Patil, former-IPS officer from Pune made a major allegation against NCP-SP Leader and Baramati MP Supriya Sule and Maharashtra Congress President Nana Patole.\n\nThe former IPS officer alleged that the two leaders had misappropriated bitcoins from a 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case and had used by the same to fund the ongoing Maharashtra Assembly Elections. Patil says he is ready to support the investigation.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, former IPS officer alleged that Amitabh Gupta, then Commissioner of Police, Pune, and Bhagyashri Nautake, then Deputy Commissioner of Police handling the Cyber Crime Investigations were involved in the misappropriation of bitcoins, which are eventually being used by the two political leaders.\n\n“My company called me as a cryptocurrency expert to investigate a case in 2018. I was arrested in that case in 2022 under allegations of fraud. I spent 14 months in jail after a trial. During that time, I was wondering what had happened, what the case was and why was I trapped. There were other colleagues also with me. We were working on finding out the truth. A witness against us, Gaurav Mehta, who is an employee of an audit firm named Sarathi Associates. A day before yesterday, he called me multiple times for 4-5 hours, but I did not respond… Finally, when I responded, he told me that in 2018, when Amit Bharadwaj was arrested, he had a cryptocurrency hardware wallet… That wallet was replaced by the then Commissioner Amitabh Gupta and another wallet was kept. We were arrested but the real perpetrators were Amitabh Gupta and his team. He (Gaurav Mehta) took the names of two IPS officers, Amitabh Gupta and Bhagyashri Nautake. He took two people’s name one is Supriya Sule and Nana Patole. He then told me that in this assembly elections bitcoins are being used,” Patil alleged.\n\nPatil claims he has access to voice notes allegedly sent by the alleged witness Gaurav Mehta, “Supriya Sule has sent three voice note messages in which she is heard asking Gaurav to encash bitcoins as the funds are needed for the elections. She is also heard assuring him not to worry about the inquiries and one they come to power, they will handle them.”\n\n“He (Gaurav Mehta) further said that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections too, the same bitcoin money is being used. On the direction of Amitabh Gupta, he (Gaurav Mehta) went to Dubai multiple times and converted the bitcoin into cash. And that cash is being used in Maharashtra elections… He (Gaurav Mehta) sent me some voice notes he had received on WhatsApp. There were 3 audio messages from Supriya Sule where she asks for cash in exchange for bitcoins. She also says that he (Gaurav Mehta) does not need to worry about inquiry, they will handle it when they come to power… He (Gaurav Mehta) sent another voice note between Amitabh Gupta and Nana Patole where Patole is asking why there is a delay in cash,” Patil further added.\n\nPatil further alleged that “in other calls, Amitabh Gupta is heard giving instructions to Gaurav to cash out bitcoins.\n\n“He (Gaurav) sent me more recordings where Amitabh Gupta was asking for Rs. 50 crores… He sent me a voice note he sent to Amitabh Gupta, saying that they had made 4 crypto wallets under the names of Patil and Ghode (my colleague) and the transactions were done from these wallets. If there is an investigation, Patil and Ghode would be caught… During the chat with me, he (Gaurav Mehta) alleged that he wanted to come out of this but his life would be in danger… I have all the screenshots and the audio and I am ready to provide them to the investigation agencies. I am ready to support the investigation,” Patil said.\n\nRavindranath Patil further said that he got this information from the whistle-blower, who was also part of the cyber experts’ team that was investigating the 2018 Cryptocurrency Fraud Case.\n\nHe further alleged that the Cyber Expert, Gaurav Mehta is currently having the custody of misappropriated bitcoins, amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees.\n\n“He said that they have already sold bitcoins worth Rs. 150 crores and they have several 100 crores more… The cash was used in Lok Sabha elections and is not being used in assembly elections also,” Patil claimed.\n\nNeither of the named parties have so far reacted to Ravindra Patil’s allegations.\n\nRavindranath Patil is a former IPS officer of 2004 batch and since 2010, he was working as a Cyber Expert in corporate sector. During the investigation of 2018 Bitcoin Fraud Case, he was appointed to conduct a forensic audit.\n\nFour years later, he was named as an accused for the alleged misappropriation of bitcoins amounting to 5 Crores, and he spent nearly 14 months in Yerawada Central Prison as an undertrial. Currently, he is a practicing advocate in the Bombay High Court.\n\nThe allegations against Nana Patole and Supriya Sule follow an incident of high drams on Tuesday after the workers of Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) created a ruckus outside a hotel located at Nalasopara assembly constituency in Palghar district accusing the BJP of “distributing money.”\n\nThe BVA workers created a ruckus outside the Vivanta Hotel in Virar where BJP leader Vinod Tawde was holding a meeting with the party workers.\n\nNotably, Vinod Tawde dismissed the charge levelled by BVA that the BJP was “distributing money” ahead of the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections.\n\n“A meeting of MLAs of Nalasopara was underway. I went there to tell them about the Model Code of Conduct for the day of voting, how will voting machines be sealed and how to go about if an objection has to be made. The workers of the party (Bahujan Vikas Aghadi), Appa Thakur and Kshitij thought that we were distributing money. Let the Election Commission and Police inquire, let them get CCTV footage. I have been in the party for 40 years. Appa Thakur and Kshitij know me, and the entire party knows me. Still, I believe that the Election Commission should conduct an impartial investigation,” Tawde said.\n\nThe Maharashtra assembly elections are scheduled for November 20. The counting of votes will take place on November 23.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed. Except for the headline, the content has not been written or edited by OpIndia staff)",

		"title": "Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi meets Mufti Salman Azhari, the Islamist cleric demands strict blasphemy laws",
		"text": "On 18th November, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi met Islamist hate preacher Mufti Salman Azhari ahead of the Maharashtra assembly elections. During the meeting, the President of Samajwadi Party’s Maharashtra unit and Mufti Azhari, the latter demanded that a strict law be passed to punish those who ‘insult’ Prophet Muhammad.\n\nSP’s candidate from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar, Abu Asim Azmi also told Mufti Azhari that in his poll manifesto, he mentioned that if voted to power, he would ensure that those accused of making ‘blasphemous’ remarks against Prophet Muhammad be booked under the stringent UAPA. Other than this, the duo discussed how it is crucial that the Muslim vote does not get divided which may benefit the BJP.\n\n“I only want that…my mission is to protect the Namoos-e-Risalat (honour of Prophet Muhammad). I want that no one dares to raise a finger against the Prophet’s honour or does any Gustakhi…If you [Abu Azmi) win the election and move ahead, give me the assurance about what you will do in this respect?” Azhari asked.\n\nResponding to this, Abu Azmi said, “I have for at least a hundred times demanded from the government and on the road that if someone has insulted Prophet Muhammad, then these [laws] like 153a are useless and at least UAPA be invoked against such people. Even in my manifesto released 20 days ago, I have said that whoever indulges in insulting Prophet Muhammad, must be charged under UAPA since this is the biggest form of terrorism.”\n\nआज मुफ़्ती सलमान अज़हरी साहब से ख़ास मुलाकात और गोवंडी के मुद्दों पर हुई बातचीत। नामूस-ए-रिसालत हमारा मिशन है, हमारी मांग रही है की जो भी आप सल्लल्लाहु अलैहि वसल्लम की शाम में गुस्ताख़ी करता है उसके खिलाफ आतंक विरोधी कानून बनाया जाए,और हम तब तक चैन से नहीं बैठेंगे जब तक ये कानून… pic.twitter.com/qFEv8EMKqL — Abu Asim Azmi (@abuasimazmi) November 18, 2024\n\nTaking to X, Abu Azmi shared a video of his meeting with Mufti Salman Azhari and said, “Today, I had a special meeting with Mufti Salman Azhari and discussed the issues of Govandi. Namoos-e-Risalat is our mission, our demand is that an anti-terror law should be made against anyone who disrespects the evening of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and we will not rest until this law is made.”\n\nIt is pertinent to recall that Mufti Azhari has a long history of making derogatory remarks towards Hindus. In February 2024, Mufti Salman Azhari made headlines for his provocative speech in Junagadh. An FIR was registered against him, along with two organisers, for his comments. The speech was given on 31st January during a programme attended by a large number of Muslims on the grounds of Narayan Vidya Mandir near the Junagadh court. In the video, Azhari is heard saying, “Abhi to Karbala ka akhiri maidan baqi hai… Kuch der ki khamoshi hai, fir shore ayega… Aaj kutton ka waqt hai, kal hamara daur ayega.” (The final battle of Karbala is yet to come… a moment of silence, then there will be noise again. Today is the time of the dogs, tomorrow will be our time).” After saying this, he chants, “Labbek Ya Rasulullah” and the crowd in front repeats it.\n\nIn another provocative speech, Mufti Azhari was heard using casteist and derogatory slurs against Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath. Azhari asserted that CM Yogi was bulldozing houses and shops of poor Muslims and while doing this he was heard using highly derogatory slurs against Uttar Pradesh CM. This video was shared by a YouTube channel named ‘Barakati Network’ on 5th November 2023.\n\nMultiple cases have been registered against Azhari after several videos of his incendiary speeches went viral. It also came to light that Mufti Salman Azhari withdrew ₹27.75 lakh from a charitable trust account within 1 year. The matter came to light during a probe by the Local Crime Branch (LCB) of Junagadh district police into the financial dealings and foreign trips of Salman Azhari.\n\nIn addition to Mufti Azhari, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi also has a record of making controversial statements. Earlier this year, Abu Asim Azmi said that Uniform Civil Code (UCC) is against Islam. Speaking at the annual conference of Shikalgar Jamaat Trust, Azmi advised Muslims to ensure they have all their valid government documents ready. In December last year, Abu Azmi demanded the withdrawal of a police case filed against 11 Muslims in Dharangaon, Jalgaon, Maharashtra for allegedly raising Hamas and Palestine flags and raising anti-India slogans on 8th November 2023. Back then, OpIndia obtained the FIR registered in the case and reported that slogans like “Gustakh-e-Nabi ki ek hi saja, Sar Tan Se Juda Sar Tan Se Juda,” “Hinduo ka raja, Mera Khwaja,” “Hamas Jindabad, Bharat Murdabad,” and “Hamas tera naam roshan hoga, insha allah insha Allah”, were raised by the Muslim mob.",

		"title": "Canada bans diaspora media outlet Australia Today, MEA says it highlights Canada’s hypocrisy",
		"text": "In a shocking move, the Canadian government has blocked access to Australia Today in Canada. Australia Today is a prominent Indian subcontinental diaspora media outlet based in Australia. Canada banned the outlet after it aired a press conference of External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar alongside Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong during Jaishankar’s Australia visit. Australia Today also extensively covered Jaishankar’s visit to Australia, and also published an interview with him.\n\nSocial media handles of Australia Today have been blocked in Canada, and they are not accessible to the viewers in Canada, according to MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\n\nDuring the press conference in Canberra, minister Jaishankar raised the issue of attack on a Hindu temple in Brampton in Canada by Khalistanis, saying the incident showed how political space is being given to extremist forces in Canada. In the presence of Australian foreign minister, Jaishankar made several comments criticising the Canadian govt over its support of Khalistanis and baseless allegations against India accusing it of attacking Khalistanis in Canada.\n\nDuring the regular media briefing on Thursday, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned Canada for blocking Australia Today, saying that it is an important diaspora media outlet in Canada. He said that the ban came just a few hours after Australia Today carried the press conference of EAM Dr S Jaishankar with Penny Wong. He added that the media outlet has published several articles on Jaishankar’s visit, and also published an interview with him.\n\nCondemning the move, spokesperson Jaiswal said, “It looks strange to us. But nonetheless, what I will say that these are actions which yet again highlight the hypocrisy of Canada towards freedom of speech.”\n\n#WATCH | Delhi: On Canada blocking or banning the prominent outlet there- Australia Today, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal says, \"We understand that the social media handles, pages of this particular outlet, which is an important diaspora outlet, has been blocked and are not… pic.twitter.com/r0Igyg3Ho0 — ANI (@ANI) November 7, 2024\n\nTalking about the trigger for the ban, he said, “You would have seen that EAM in his media engagements, spoke about three things. One was Canada making allegations and a pattern has developed without any specific evidence. The second thing he highlighted was surveillance of Indian diplomats happening in Canada, which he termed as unacceptable. Third thing which he highlighted was the political space which has been given in Canada to anti-India elements.”\n\nConcluding that Canada banned Australia Today for carrying the comments of EAM Jaishankar, Jaiswal said, “So you can draw your conclusions from that, why Australia Today channel was blocked by Canada.”",

		"title": "Punjab and Haryana’s claim over Chandigarh: A decades-old Congress-created problem",
		"text": "The Chandigarh dispute between Punjab and Haryana has once again escalated. Haryana has recently requested land in Chandigarh to construct a new Vidhan Sabha building, which has become a flashpoint. The ruling party of Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), has strongly opposed the move, claiming that Chandigarh belongs solely to Punjab. The party has categorically refused to allow Haryana to construct a Vidhan Sabha building, despite the fact that the current Vidhan Sabha, or the Haryana State Assembly, is located in the Union Territory of Chandigarh itself.\n\nThough the issue is escalating between the two states, it is not a new battle. The two neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana have been at loggerheads over Chandigarh since 1966, when Haryana was carved out of Punjab. At that time, Congress’s handling of Punjab’s reorganisation was fundamentally flawed and has been left unresolved for decades, deepening the dispute between the two states as time passes.\n\nThe issue came to fore after the Union Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change reportedly gave clearance allowing the allotment of 10 acres of land in Chandigarh to Haryana for the construction of its assembly building. In exchange, Haryana has offered 12 acres of land in Panchkula near IT Park Road in Chandigarh.\n\nNotably, the demand for a separate Assembly building was raised by the then Haryana Chief Minister, Manohar Lal Khattar, during the 30th meeting of the Northern Zonal Council in Jaipur on 9 July 2022. Later, Home Minister Amit Shah announced the allocation of land. The Chandigarh administration decided to provide 10 acres of land to the Haryana government in return for 12 acres of Panchkula land bordering Chandigarh. The process was stayed owing to environmental and forest clearance issues, which have now been resolved.\n\nBut now the Punjab govt is opposing this allocation, claiming that the entire Chandigarh belongs to Punjab. Haryana govt does not agree with it. Haryana minister Anil Vij said that Punjab can have Chandigarh if they give Hindi-speaking areas to Haryana. He added that at present Chandigarh belongs to none of the states as it is a union territory, and therefore both states have equal rights on it.\n\nThe flawed foundation – Congress’s decision in 1966\n\nBefore the partition, Lahore was the capital of the undivided Punjab province. After Lohore went to Pakistan, Shimla was made the temporary capital of Indian Punjab state. At that time, the government decided to set up a modern city, and thus Chandigarh was created, India’s first planned city. It became the capital of Punjab in 1953.\n\nPunjab was again divided in 1966, and Haryana was carved out of the state comprising Hindi-speaking areas. Chandigarh was on the newly demarketed border of the two states, and became the capital of both Punjab and Haryana. At that time, the Congress government decided not to assign Chandigarh to one of the two states or to divide the city itself, instead declaring it a Union Territory (UT).\n\nThis decision was described as temporary, with the Indira Gandhi government at the centre announcing that Harana would eventually receive its own capital city. In 1970, the central govt announced that Chandigarh city should go to Punjab, and Haryana would get a new capital city. However, successive governments failed to fulfil this promise, leaving Chandigarh in limbo. It has remained a shared capital between Punjab and Haryana to this day, with no resolution to the matter in sight.\n\nNotably, giving Chandigarh the status of a UT was not a solution, but merely a deferral of the real problem. The Congress government at the time avoided taking a clear stance on the ownership of Chandigarh, fearing backlash from Punjab or Haryana, whichever state lost the city. Over time, there has been a consistent lack of clarity from the central government—irrespective of the ruling party—on the city’s status. The situation has now reached a point of contention between the two states, with no resolution in sight.\n\nThe administrative infrastructure in Chandigarh is shared by both states, including their Vidhan Sabha offices. This arrangement has functioned reasonably well for decades but was never intended to be a long-term solution.\n\nNot to forget, on 29 January 1970, the central government announced that Chandigarh should, as a whole, be transferred to Punjab. The announcement was made after Fateh Singh, leader of the Punjabi Suba movement, threatened to self-immolate if Chandigarh was not handed over to Punjab. On a temporary basis, Haryana was provided accommodation for running offices in the civil secretariat and given space in Punjab’s Vidhan Sabha. This arrangement was intended to last only five years, but six decades have since passed. Political unwillingness to resolve the matter has left Chandigarh as a “disputed” city.\n\nAt the time of the independence in 1947, India had only 12 states, now the number is 28. The original states have undergone several splits to arrive at the current status. After every split, the new states got their own capitals within their geographical boundaries. But the split of Punjab was unusual in this regard and has led to the current dispute.\n\nHaryana’s demand for a new Vidhan Sabha building\n\nIn recent years, Haryana has intensified its demand for a separate Vidhan Sabha building in Chandigarh. The state’s leaders have argued that the existing shared arrangement is no longer appropriate to meet its growing administrative needs. Haryana seeks to construct its own Assembly building within the Union Territory to address the logistical challenges it has been facing, which, according to the state government, would improve governance.\n\nCurrently, the Haryana Assembly operates out of the Punjab Civil Secretariat. This building was not designed to accommodate two independent legislatures and secretariats. Over the past six decades, the shared infrastructure between the two states has proven to be inefficient, especially as Haryana’s administrative requirements have expanded.\n\nHaryana Minister Anil Vij spoke to media on the matter and said, “If we talk about Chandigarh, he should read the previous agreements in which it is clearly written that the Hindi speaking areas will be given to Haryana…We have as much right on Chandigarh as Punjab has. Chandigarh is a Union Territory and not a part of Punjab… All the employees working in the Union Territory are from both Punjab and Haryana.”\n\n#WATCH | Ambala: On the statement of Punjab Minister Harpal Singh Cheema, Haryana Minister Anil Vij says, \"…If we talk about Chandigarh, he should read the previous agreements in which it is clearly written that the Hindi speaking areas will be given to Haryana…We have as… pic.twitter.com/Utnl1RE0TS — ANI (@ANI) November 16, 2024\n\nPunjab’s rejection – Why state opposes Haryana’s plan\n\nThe ruling party of Punjab, AAP, has outrightly opposed Haryana’s request. Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema has declared, “Chandigarh belongs to Punjab,” and vowed to block any move to allocate land to Haryana for its Assembly building. AAP appears to view the issue as a political opportunity to gain an electoral upper hand in the state. Speaking to media, Cheema said, “We have given a memorandum to the Governor stating that Haryana should not be allotted land in Chandigarh (to construct Haryana Assembly) and their request should be declined…Punjab has the right to Chandigarh and we will not let it go. AAP will fight for this. Haryana’s claim is absolutely wrong.”\n\n#WATCH | Chandigarh | On AAP delegation's meeting with Punjab Governor, Punjab Minister Harpal Singh Cheema says, \"We have given a memorandum to the Governor stating that Haryana should not be allotted land in Chandigarh (to construct Haryana Assembly) and their request should be… pic.twitter.com/ccTxNa30MO — ANI (@ANI) November 15, 2024\n\nNotably, the rhetoric that Chandigarh belongs exclusively to Punjab is not only impractical but also inflammatory. Chandigarh has served as the shared capital for both states for nearly six decades. While Punjab claims that Chandigarh historically belongs to it, Haryana’s demand for a functional administrative space does not challenge Punjab’s claim to the UT. AAP’s hardline stance risks alienating Haryana while doing little to address the larger issue of Chandigarh’s status.\n\nTaking a dig at Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann’s statement that he would not allow Haryana to construct new Vidhan Sabha in Chandigarh, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini said, “First they stopped the SYL water, now they have come to the Vidhan Sabha. Haryana has a right over Chandigarh too. You should work for the people. I would like to tell Bhagwant Mann that you could have bought the crops of the farmers, you are not giving them MSP. You want to divert attention by saying that you will not let us form the Vidhan Sabha here. I would request him to take steps in the interest of the farmers. Why do they say such things that we have stopped the water, we will not let them form the Vidhan Sabha. What does this mean? One should act wisely…”\n\n#WATCH | Chandigarh: On Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann's statement, Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini says, \"…First they stopped the SYL water, now they have come to the Vidhan Sabha. Haryana has a right over Chandigarh too. You should work for the people. I would like to tell Bhagwant… pic.twitter.com/N81KwjdMHG — ANI (@ANI) November 15, 2024\n\nThe path forward – Dialogue over divisive rhetoric\n\nIf Punjab, Haryana, and the central government genuinely wish to resolve the Chandigarh dispute, they must initiate a dialogue with a balanced approach that respects all stakeholders’ claims and needs. Haryana’s request for a new Assembly building is not unreasonable, given the logistical challenges of the current shared arrangement. On the other hand, political leaders must move beyond rhetoric and engage in constructive discussions to find a long-term solution.\n\nThe current strategy of politicising the matter will only further complicate the issue and deepen the divide between the two states. It will also make future negotiations more challenging. The Chandigarh dispute is a legacy of Congress’s indecision, but resolving it will require political will and cooperation—not inflammatory rhetoric or short-term political gains.",

		"text": "Haryana’s Anshul Kamboj etched his name into the history book by becoming just the third bowler in Ranji Trophy history to bag all 10 wickets in an innings.\n\nThe 23-year-old quick, who hails from Haryana, made history during their round five Ranji Trophy clash against Kerala at Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium.\n\nBefore Anshul, Bengal’s Premangshu Chatterjee (10/20) and Rajasthan’s Pradeep Sunderam (10/78) were already a part of the remarkable feat.\n\nChatterjee became the first Indian to enter the club with his record-shattering performance against Assam in January 1957. Sunderam was the next to claim the feat in November 1985 against Vidarbha.\n\nOverall, Anshul became the sixth Indian bowler to enter the exclusive club for the feat, which features the likes of Anil Kumble, Subhash Gupte, Debashish Mohanty and others.\n\nAnshul finished with figures of 10/49 in 30.1 overs, which forced Kerala to pack on 291 on Day 3. Anshul’s incredible display marked the first time he bagged a ten-wicket haul in first-class cricket.\n\nOverall, the youngster has 57 scalps to his name in 19 matches, averaging 24.14. Apart from his capability with the ball, Anshul has made valuable contributions with the bat, racking 358 runs to his name in his first-class career.\n\nAnshul’s rapid rise in domestic cricket has been a sight to behold. He recently featured for India A in the Men’s Emerging Asia Cup and scythed four wickets in three matches.\n\nHe delivered a Man of the Match performance against Pakistan Shaheens with figures of 3/33.\n\nAnshul was also a force to be reckoned with in the Duleep Trophy 2024-25. While featuring for India C, Anshul took 16 wickets and ended the Duleep Trophy as the leading wicket-taker.\n\nIn IPL 2024, Anshul made his debut in the cash-rich league for five-time champions Mumbai Indians. He managed to claim two wickets in three games.\n\nHis surge extends to the Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he was a crucial cog in Haryana’s triumph in the 2023-24 season, with his remarkable 17 wickets in 10 games.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

		"title": "Anaya Bangar, daughter of Sanjay Bangar, who used to be Aryan, expresses dismay as she no longer can play professional cricket",
		"text": "Anaya Bangar, formerly known as Aryan Bangar, child of former Indian cricketer Sanjay Bangar, is making headlines after sharing her journey as a transgender woman. Before becoming Anaya through Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) in 2023, she was active in the field of cricket.\n\nHowever, both the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) introduced rules barring any transgender person from participating in women’s cricket. In a now-deleted video, Anaya shared her photos before surgery with several prominent names in cricket and wrote, “Chasing my dream of playing cricket professionally has been a journey filled with sacrifices, resilience, and unwavering dedication. From early mornings on the field to facing the doubts and judgments of others, every step has demanded strength.”\n\nSanjay Bangar's son undergoes harmone replacement surgery.\n\n\n\nAryan becomes Anaya!\n\n\n\nHave a look at Ananya's instagram post!#Cricket #CricketTwitter #SanjayBangar pic.twitter.com/esePJjf4Ua — Amit T (@amittalwalkar) November 10, 2024\n\nChanges through hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\nIn a recent video shared by Anaya on Instagram, she mentioned that during the 11 months of HRT, she has lost muscle and her body has changed significantly. However, she claimed that she felt happy, and the therapy has reduced her dysphoria. For those unaware, dysphoria can be described as a feeling of profound unhappiness, distress or dissatisfaction, where a person feels uncomfortable in their own body or as if they are in the wrong body.\n\nOn 27 October, she shared a report from 20th October in which the ECB announced the banning of transgender women from women’s professional cricket. In the post, she wrote, “It sucks being a trans athlete.”\n\nAnaya’s disconnection from Cricket\n\nIn August 2024, when Anaya Bangar was nine months into HRT, she shared a post describing her journey and how she had to disconnect from cricket, which had been a significant part of her life.\n\nIn the post, Anaya wrote: “From a young age, cricket has always been a part of my life. Growing up, I watched my dad with awe as he represented and coached the country, and it wasn’t long before I started dreaming of following in his footsteps. The passion, the discipline, and the dedication he showed to the sport were deeply inspiring to me. Cricket became my love, my ambition, and my future. I’ve spent my entire life honing my skills, hoping that one day, I would get the chance to represent my country, just like him. I never thought I’d have to consider giving up the sport that has been my passion, my love, and my escape. But here I am, facing a painful reality. As a trans woman on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), my body has changed drastically. I’ve been losing the muscle mass, strength, muscle memory, and athletic abilities I once relied on. The game I’ve loved for so long is slipping away from me.”\n\nAnaya Bangar further expressed that it hurt her more because there are no proper regulations for trans women in cricket. She added: “It feels like the system is forcing me out, not because I lack the drive or talent, but because the rules haven’t caught up with the reality of who I am. My testosterone levels are down to 0.5 nmol, the lowest it can be for an average cisgender woman. Despite this, I still don’t have a place to represent my country or play at a professional level as my authentic self.”\n\n“To make matters worse, the system says that to compete in women’s sports, I should have transitioned before male puberty. But here’s the contradiction: society and the legal system make it illegal to transition as a minor. So, what am I supposed to do? The system is forcing me into an impossible situation, setting standards I couldn’t have met even if I’d wanted to. It’s heartbreaking that the body I’ve worked so hard to align with my true self is now seen as a barrier to continuing my cricket journey in the women’s category. We need policies that don’t make us choose between our identity and our passions. Trans women deserve the right to compete, play, and thrive”, she said.\n\nICC regulations on trans participation\n\nWhile Anaya Bangar decided to undergo a gender reassignment surgery followed by HRT, the regulations regarding the participation of trans persons in cricket were clear. Notably, the ICC had previously allowed trans women to participate in women’s cricket. Twenty-nine-year-old Danielle McGahey was the first transgender player to feature in international cricket in early 2023. However, her participation drew significant criticism, leading to nine months of consultations among ICC members. Finally, on 21st November 2023, the ICC Board approved new gender eligibility regulations for the international game in consultation with stakeholders.\n\nAccording to the media release, the new policy was based on the principles of protecting the integrity of the women’s game, safety, fairness, and inclusion. This means that any male-to-female participants who have undergone any form of male puberty will not be eligible to participate in international women’s cricket, regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken.\n\nThe review of the policy was led by the ICC Medical Advisory Committee, chaired by Dr Peter Harcourt. The media release specified that it related solely to gender eligibility for international women’s cricket. The board clarified that gender eligibility at the domestic level is a matter for each individual Member Board and may be influenced by local legislation.\n\nAt the time, ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said, “The changes to the gender eligibility regulations resulted from an extensive consultation process and are founded in science and aligned with the core principles developed during the review. Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players.”\n\nThe policy will be reviewed again in 2026.\n\nECB’s domestic regulation changes\n\nAs the policy clearly mentioned that the decision to allow transgender women to play in women’s teams at the domestic level was a matter for each individual Member Board, Anaya Bangar, who currently plays in the United Kingdom, was still able to play for the ECB. However, in October 2024, the England and Wales Cricket Board decided not to allow transgender women to feature in the top two tiers of the new women’s domestic structure or the women’s Hundred.\n\nIn a press release, the ECB stated that it had consulted “relevant science and medical evidence” and considered “fairness, safety, and inclusion.” Trans women, however, will be able to participate in tier three of the new domestic system, which will be launched in 2025. Furthermore, they will be allowed to participate in recreational cricket as well.\n\nOther sports regulations\n\nWorld Athletics, the international governing organisation for athletics, banned transgender women (men who have transitioned to women) from competing in the female category at international events in march 2023. The decision came after several instances came to fore where male athletes competed in women’s tournaments claiming they identify as “women”.",

		"title": "Olympics gold medalist Imane Khelif identified as man in medical report",
		"text": "Imane Khelif, an Algerian boxer, made headlines during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Khelif, who was suspected to be a biological man by many, won a gold medal in the women’s 66-kilogram category even though many people questioned her eligibility for the sport. Now, a new scandal broke out months after the Paris Games concluded when a leaked medical report revealed that Khelif is, in fact, a man.\n\nFrench journalist Djaffar Ait Aoudia obtained the report, which revealed that the 25-year-old has internal testicles and an XY chromosome composition, which could imply a hereditary disorder called 5-alpha reductase deficiency. This disorder affects sexual development and frequently leads to limited secondary masculine traits and ambiguous genitalia. Khelif’s anatomy, including the lack of a uterus and the existence of what was characterized as a micro-penis, was described in the report.\n\nThe report was prepared in June 2023 by medical experts from Mohamed Lamine Debaghine Hospital in Algiers and Kremlin-Bicêtre Hospital in Paris. Additionally, it suggested hormone therapy and surgical correction to match Khelif’s physical characteristics to her self-perceived gender identity.\n\nHarbhajan Singh, the former Indian cricketer and World Cup winner, also responded to the development by tagging the Olympics on social media and asking them to take back the gold medal.\n\nTake the Gold back @Olympics This isn’t fair https://t.co/ZO3yJmqdpY — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) November 5, 2024\n\nBritish journalist Piers Morgan also shared the report and added, “Confirmation of what some of us said at the time: Khelif is a biological man.” He demanded that the gold medal should be taken away and given to the “best actual” woman.\n\nConfirmation of what some of us said at the time: Khelif is a biological man. The gold medal should now be stripped and awarded to the best actual woman. https://t.co/iqVlqQhrwr — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 4, 2024\n\n“Remember the man who won an Olympic gold medal in women’s boxing,” asked the United States swimmer Riley Gains and highlighted that Khelif has XY chromosomes, male testosterone levels, testicles, and a micropenis. “But that never mattered, they believe that words & feelings make you a woman, not biology,” she accused.\n\nRemember the man who won an Olympic gold medal in women’s boxing?\n\n\n\nHis medical reports show he has XY chromosomes, male testosterone levels, testicles, & a micropenis.\n\n\n\nBut that never mattered—they believe that words & feelings make you woman, not biology.https://t.co/Ip8KLvEt6S — Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) November 4, 2024\n\nThe Algerian’s involvement in women’s sports has put her in the public eye. She was not permitted to compete in the 2023 World Championship gold medal bout in New Delhi by the International Boxing Association (IBA) which sparked a lot of heated debate around the issue. It gained more attention at the Olympics in Paris, where prominent public figures voiced their opinions and demanded that Khelif’s eligibility be reviewed.\n\nDonald Trump also used her example in an advertisement criticizing the Biden-Harris administration’s gender-ad athletics policy. When asked about their stance on transgender issues, Republican leaders, including Vivek Ramaswamy and vice presidential candidate JD Vance, similarly stated that they would not permit men to participate in female-only sports.\n\n“I’m a woman like any other woman. I was born as a woman, I live as a woman, and I am qualified,” Imane Khelif claimed while responding to the row. Notably, J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk, among others were named in a criminal complaint filed to French authorities in August over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment” against the Algerian boxer, according to her attorney Nabil Boudi. The development transpired after people expressed that “only women should be allowed to compete in women’s sports.” The legal action was also initiated against X (formerly Twitter).\n\nInterestingly, Imane Khelif had won her first Olympic boxing match after Italian opponent Angela Carini quit the bout after 46 seconds. The Italian boxer, while in tears, said, “I have always honoured my country with loyalty. This time, I didn’t win because I couldn’t fight anymore. So I ended the match. I’m used to suffering. I’ve never taken a punch like that, it’s impossible to continue. I’m nobody to say it’s illegal. I have never been hit so hard in my life. It’s up to the IOC to judge.”",

The result of that has come out… All the machinery and police administration were deployed, and voters were intimidated and threatened. This is a complete murder of democracy.”\n\nRai said that the INDIA bloc took the lead in Jharkhand because the Mahagathan government in Jharkhand did good work in the state.\n\nHe said, “Our government did good work in Jharkhand.

		"title": "Indian national Sanjay Kaushik indicted by US DOJ for exporting aviation components to Russia",
		"text": "On 20th November, an Indian national, identified as 57-year-old Sanjay Kaushik, was indicted by the United States for allegedly conspiring to export controlled aviation components to Russia. In a press release, Department of Justice said that Kaushik violated the Export Control Reform Act. The indictment was filed on 20th November in the District of Oregon in which Kaushik has been accused of attempting to export navigation and flight control systems with dual civilian and military applications through India to Russian end users. Notably, Kaushik was arrested on 17th October this year in Miami, Florida, under a criminal complaint and warrant issued by the District of Oregon.\n\nAllegations of fraudulent export activities\n\nThe press release stated that court documents against Kaushik revealed that he allegedly began conspiring with others in March 2023 after Russia-Ukraine war started. Kaushik and others have been accused of unlawfully acquiring aerospace technology from the US under false pretences. According to DOJ, Kaushik reportedly claimed that the components were meant for his Indian company but were intended for Russian entities.\n\nOne of the key instances cited in the indictment involved the purchase of an Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS), which is a crucial device for aircraft navigation and flight control. The system was acquired from an Oregon-based supplier. If these components are to be sold to Russian entities, a special export license is required from Department of Commerce, which Kaushik reportedly did not acquire or inform the alleged actual intent to buy. Prosecutors alleged that Kaushik and his associates “misrepresented” the end user as a civilian helicopter operator in India to obtain the component. However, the component was intercepted before it left the US.\n\nPotential penalties and ongoing investigation\n\nKaushik will face severe legal repercussions if he gets convicted in the case including up to 20 years in prison and USD 1 million fine for each charge in the indictment. A federal district court judge will determine the sentencing while factoring in the US Sentencing Guidelines and staturoty considerations.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in Portland and prosecuted by attorneys from the Department of Justice’s National Security Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon are investigating the case.\n\nPart of Task Force KleptoCapture’s efforts\n\nIn March 2022, Justice Department established an initiative known as Task Force KelptoCapture to enforce sanctions, export controls and countermeansures against Russia after it initiated military action against Ukraine which turned into a full-fledged war between the two countries that continues till date. Deputy Attorney General’s Office is leading the initiative. The case against Kaushik falls under its jurisdiction.\n\nIndictment against Adani Group\n\nOn 21st November, a five-count criminal indictment was unsealed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charging prominent Indian executives including the Chairman of the Adani Group Gautam Adani by linking them to an alleged bribery and fraud scheme, Reuters reported citing US prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of New York, “A five-count criminal indictment was unsealed in federal court charging Gautam Adani, Sagar R. Adani, and Vneet S. Jaain, with conspiracies to commit securities and wire fraud and substantive securities fraud for their roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from U.S. investors and global financial institutions on the basis of false and misleading statements.”\n\n“As alleged, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars and Gautam S. Adani, Sagar R. Adani and Vneet S. Jaain lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors,” stated United States Attorney Breon Peace. The indictment also accuses the executive of obstructing investigations by the FBI, Department of Justice (DOJ), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The US Attorney’s office says that the charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nAdani Group rubbishes baseless allegations made by US Justice Dept and SEC\n\nOn Thursday (21st November), the spokesperson for the Adani Group rubbished allegations levelled against the Directors of ‘Adani Green’ by the US Department of Justice and the SEC. “The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,” it stated. The Indian conglomerate further stated that all legal recourse is being sought.\n\n“The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations,” it pointed out. The spokesperson for the Adani Group concluded, “We assure our stakeholders, partners and employees that we are a law-abiding organisation, fully compliant with all laws.” The development comes hours after the SEC announced that it was pressing charges against Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and others in a $250 million bribery and fraud case.\n\nUS put Indian companies, businessmen on sanctions list for doing business with Russia amid war with Ukraine\n\nEarlier this month, the United States government has put some Indian companies and businessmen on the sanctions list for supposedly benefitting Russia amid its war against Ukraine. It has sanctioned Ascend Aviation India Pvt. Ltd. for sending more than 700 shipments containing $2,00,000 worth of Common High-Priority List (CHPL) items to Russia-based firms between March 2023 and March 2024. Two partial shareholders of Ascend Aviation, namely, Sudhir Kumar and Vivek Kumar Mishra were also put on the sanctions list. Another India-based company targeted by the Biden administration happens to be Mask Trans. It has accused the firm of supplying $3,00,000 Common High-Priority List (CHPL) items to Russia based company between June 2023 and April 2024.\n\nTSMD Global Pvt Ltd., an India-based company, was sanctioned for shipping $430,00,000 CHPL items to Russian firms between July 2023 and March 2024. The shipped items s include Electronic Integrated Circuits, CPUs and fixed capacitors. Another firm targeted by the US government was Futrevo for supplying $1.4 million worth of CHPL items to Russia-based companies between January 2023 and February 2024.",

She is a resident of Sambhal Gate in the Chandausi area of ​​Sambhal district. She lived in the Katghar neighbourhood along with her family. Meanwhile, the offender befriended her and lured her into a romantic relationship under the pretext of employment. He even obtained a fraudulent Aadhaar Card in which a locality in Bijnor district was mentioned as his address.\n\nHis real identity was exposed after investigation. He was found to be from Rampur’s Peela Talab region which falls in the jurisdiction of Ganj police station. The perpetrator took her out, sexually assaulted her and then pressured her to convert to Islam. She reached home on the evening of 20th November and narrated the ordeal to her family members. He reportedly kept her as his wife. Superintendent of Police (SP) City Ranvijay Singh informed that the culprit has been apprehended and a case has been lodged based on the complaint.\n\nThe other case was reported on 11th November from the Gogunda police station area of ​​Udaipur, Rajasthan where two cousins aged 16 and 17 years old who were in 11th grade committed suicide. Afterwards, 19-year-old Shahnawaz was nabbed from Uttar Pradesh’s Hapur and brought to Udaipur. He was blackmailing them through social media and is accused of provoking them to end their lives. Their bodies were discovered in a field 500 meters away from their house in Gehloton Ka Gurha village of Jaswantgarh Gram Panchayat.\n\nThey were wearing clothes of the same colour and a black and white thread was tied around their necks. Their bodies were sent for post-mortem by the cops after which it was revealed that their deaths were due to the consumption of poison. The family had submitted a complaint with the police charging murder and stated that the duo had been missing since the 10th of November evening. They looked for them till late at night but failed and started the search again in the morning when they spotted the corpses.\n\nThe cops initiated a probe after getting information about the matter and eventually apprehended the perpetrator by dispatching teams to Uttar Pradesh. The family had revealed that the girls had been under stress for the past few days. It was confirmed that they were in contact with him after the police looked into their mobile phones and social media accounts. The cops reportedly recovered a notebook with Kalma and Quranic verses scribbled in it in the school bags of the girls.\n\nFurthermore, a few phrases were written in Urdu and Hindi, indicating that they were being influenced. Both had changed their names to Anisa and Muskan on social media. The police believe that they were brainwashed to convert to Islam. The possibility of love jihad has also been expressed in the case. The family has handed over the mobile phones and notebooks of both the girls to the authorities.\n\nIt was disclosed during police interrogation that the accused utilized Instagram to communicate with both minors and even visited Udaipur. They were troubled for at least two months, however, did not unveil anything despite being asked. It has come to light that he pressured them and extorted Rs 12,000 from them. He was demanding more money. After making friends with them, he made requests for money, sometimes claiming that his phone was broken and other times citing other reasons.\n\nMoreover, he would constantly press them to talk on the phone with him. He also used to invite them to meet him in Gogunda. They couldn’t bear any more of his harassment and finally killed themselves. Police are investigating the matter. An official informed, “He was in contact with both the sisters for a long time. He also used to pressure them to talk repeatedly. Both the sisters were upset by this.” Gogunda police station in-charge Shaitan Singh stated that he used to talk to both of them simultaneously. Police are trying to find out whether both the sisters were instigated to commit suicide.",

		"title": "Swara Bhaskar claims she and her Muslim husband are 'progressive', had earlier sought votes in the 'honour of Prophet Muhammad'",
		"text": "Swara Bhaskar who is far more famous for her controversies than films, has yet again jumped to brazenly defend her duplicity after being called out by netizens. The small-time Bollywood actor who otherwise portrays herself as a beacon of feminism was recently spotted meeting a radical Muslim cleric and asking for votes in the name of the ‘honour of prophet Muhammad’ during the recently concluded voting for the Maharashtra assembly election. The result will be out on 23rd November.\n\nNotably, many social media users pointed out the same and also highlighted her conservative attire. However, this didn’t sit well with Bhaskar who on 21st November posted a few photographs of herself in modern outfits with her politician husband Fahad Ahmad to assert that the couple is allegedly progressive. She also slammed the ‘sanghis’ for pointing out her glaring hypocrisy and wrote, “I didn’t realize my wardrobe choices post marriage are a national cyber debate (bizarre).”\n\nBhaskar, who is a close friend of UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) accused Umar Khalid then referred to the images she shared and termed them as “giving sanghi vermin more fodder for their dung.” She added, “I am sorry Fahad Ahmad doesn’t fit your stereotype of a conservative Muslim husband. LOL,” in a miserable attempt to project him as a liberal. It’s interesting to note that she deliberately chose to share these photos after the voting was over apparently to avoid upsetting MVA’s Muslim vote bank.\n\nI didn’t realise my wardrobe choices post marriage are a national cyber debate (bizarre!).. Here are more pics of me post marriage to give Sanghi vermin more fodder for their dung 💩 Im sorry @FahadZirarAhmad doesn’t fit your stereotype of a conservative Muslim husband. Lol! pic.twitter.com/z5SshleHCB — Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) November 20, 2024\n\nNotably, Bhaskar and Fahad Ahmad met extreme Islamist cleric Maulana Sajjad Nomani who had been urging Muslims to cast their votes in large numbers for the NCP (Nationalist Congress Party-Sharad Pawar faction)-Congress-Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) coalition (Maha Vikas Aghadi). Fahad Ahmad is the NCP candidate from the Anushakti Nagar Vidhan Sabha seat.\n\nMore importantly, Nomani is infamous for asking Muslims not to send their girls to schools and colleges as it is haram (forbidden) in Islam. Additionally, he warned that parents who send their daughters to school will be sent to Hell (Jahannam). Despite wearing a hijab, he stressed that Muslim females should never be left alone even if she is going to college.\n\nOn 17th November, while Bhaskar was campaigning for her husband she alleged, “It’s true that I was born into a Hindu family and it’s true that I married a Muslim. But I want to make it clear that it doesn’t matter which caste or religion you were born into to have respect for Prophet Muhammad,” in a bid to incite religious sentiments to win over Muslim votes.\n\nShe added, “Those who are repeatedly questioning the faith and religion of my husband, today I would like to ask them- Where was your faith when Anil Rathod arranged a gathering for Nitesh Rane here, where he insulted your Holy Prophet? Then where was your faith? Where was your faith when the rapists of Bilkis Bano were garlanded by BJP leaders.”",

		"title": "'We have lost everything': Kashmiri Pandits cry as Jammu Development Authorities demolish their shops without notice, details",
		"text": "On Wednesday, 20th November, massive outrage was witnessed in Jammu city as around 12 shops belonging to displaced Kashmiri Pandits were razed to the ground by the Jammu Development Authority (JDA) without prior notice. The shops that were taken down were located on the land of the JDA in the city. This action enraged the shop owners who protested against the authorities and demanded action against them.\n\nAccording to officials, the shops, which were being removed as a part of the demolition drive, were constructed by displaced Kashmiri Pandits on the JDA land adjacent to the Muthi camp about three decades earlier. “The old shops were located on land belonging to the JDA, which had given a deadline to the Kashmiri Pandits to remove their arrangements on their own within three months, failing which encroachments would be removed,” the officials were quoted as saying.\n\nHowever, the Kashmiri Pandits who were settled in the locality three decades ago demanded action against the authorities saying that no prior notice was issued regarding the demolition of the properties. JDA Vice President Pankaj Sharma claimed that notices to the concerned parties were sent on 20th January and that they had ‘promised’ to vacate the shops. “After that due to elections, no action could be initiated from our side,” he said.\n\nAs per Sharma, there were 25 kanals of land in the Muthi area, where Kashmiri Pandit refugees were initially settled in one-room domed dwellings, followed by two-room apartment allocations in Purkhu and Jagti. “Since residences are to be built here for 208 underprivileged people, a tender has also been advertised. In such cases, we must evacuate the land. Despite this, the state has assured to set up ten shops for these people,” he said.\n\nWhile this happened, several political parties like the BJP, PDP, and Apni Party expressed dissatisfaction over the action and demanded resettlement of the concerned Kashmiri Pandits.\n\n“Heartbreaking scenes emerge as Kashmiri Pandit shopkeepers stand helplessly by the rubble of their demolished shops, reportedly brought down by the JDA without prior notice. This comes as yet another blow to a community that has endured unimaginable hardships for decades,” Mehbooba Mufti of PDP said.\n\n“What began as targeted demolitions of assets of tribal community has now been extended to Kashmiri Pandits, further deepening their sense of alienation and loss. We urge CM Omar Abdullah to step in and address this grave injustice with compassion and urgency,” she added indicating that the shops were demolished without issuing prior notices.\n\nShe also shared a video of an old victim crying over the demolition of his shop saying, “We have lost everything. Where shall we go now?”\n\nHeartbreaking scenes emerge as Kashmiri Pandit shopkeepers stand helplessly by the rubble of their demolished shops, reportedly brought down by the JDA without prior notice.

What… pic.twitter.com/jyQ1w9yPhB — Mehbooba Mufti (@MehboobaMufti) November 21, 2024\n\nJ&K Apni Party founder chief Altaf Bukhari said, “Jammu Development Authority (JDA) should not have demolished the temporary shops belonging to Kashmiri Pandit refugees at Muthi Camp, Jammu. These small establishments have been the primary source of livelihood for these poor migrants for over past three decades. If demolition was necessary, the administration should have first arranged alternatives to protect their livelihoods.”\n\n“Such actions are disappointing, especially under an elected government that is expected to prioritize the welfare of its citizens. I urge the administration to ensure justice for the affected shop owners by either permitting them to rebuild their shops or providing them with suitable alternatives to sustain their livelihoods,” he added.\n\nJammu Development Authority (JDA) should not have demolished the temporary shops belonging to Kashmiri Pandit refugees at Muthi Camp, Jammu.

If demolition… — Altaf Bukhari (@SMAltafBukhari) November 21, 2024\n\nBJP spokesperson GL Raina meanwhile called the demolition an ‘act of revenge’ by the NC-Congress coalition government. He demanded to provide immediate alternative arrangements to the affected families.\n\nJDA meanwhile reiterated that the said land of Muthi Camp has now been allotted for the construction of 208 flats for the economically weaker sections. However, Relief Commissioner Arvind Karwani assured that new shops would be built soon for the affected shopkeepers. 10 shops are almost ready for these people, which are in Camp-2.\n\nRegarding this incident, the BJP further directly targeted the NC-Congress coalition government. It is believed that after the change of government, such action on the Kashmiri Pandit community could be a part of a political vendetta.\n\nNotably, in October this year, the NC-Congress alliance formed a government in the Union Territory designating Omar Abdullah as the CM. Now, all the parties like the BJP, PDP, and Apni Party are requesting the CM to provide immediate alternative arrangements to the affected displaced Kashmiri families.",

		"title": "CPIM declares Adani 'guilty' of bribery, demands CBI case into allegations in the US",
		"text": "On Thursday, 21st November, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPIM declared the Adani Group industrialist Gautam Adani guilty of bribery and accused the Modi-led government of protecting the businessman. This is a day after the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charged prominent Indian executives including the Chairman of the Adani Group Gautam Adani by linking them to an alleged bribery and fraud scheme. Notably, the US Court levelled mere allegations against Adani, however, the CPIM declared the industrialist guilty of corruption as it demanded a probe into the case.\n\nAs the US Department of Justice stated, ‘the charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.’ However, the CPIM, in its statement, already declared the industrialist guilty after it indicated that the ‘large-scale bribery charges by Adani had to be exposed in the United States.’\n\n“It is shameful that such large-scale bribery and suborning of government officials by the Adanis had to be exposed not in India but in the United States through their criminal justice system. Gautam Adani and his business empire have had full protection from the Modi government in executing his unlawful and criminal activities,” the official press statement by the CPIM read.\n\nCPIM Polit Bureau Statement on #Adani Indictment in a US Court by the Department of Justice:\n\nBook Adani on Corruption Chargeshttps://t.co/bwD2uyhJMC pic.twitter.com/8AU4l5q9Tl — CPI (M) (@cpimspeak) November 21, 2024\n\nThe statement also accused Prime Minister Modi of allegedly protecting the industrialist from investigation and inquiry. “PM Modi himself had shielded Adani from any enquiry or prosecution on the charges emanating from the Hindenburg expose,” it added.\n\n“The Modi government cannot hide behind any smokescreen now. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) must be directed to immediately file a case based on the material provided by the prosecution in the United States. Bribery of public servants comes under the Prevention of Corruption Act, under the CBI’s remit. A full-fledged investigation by an independent agency is required to unearth all other wrongdoings by the Adani group of companies,” the party demanded.\n\nThe Adani group meanwhile has denied all the allegations of alleged bribery levelled by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,” the Directors of Adani Group stated. The Indian conglomerate further noted that all legal recourse is being sought.\n\nOn the other hand, CPIM party leader Brinda Karat while talking to the news agency targeted the BJP over the incident and stated that the BJP was protecting the interest of the Adani Groups. “We have demanded to book Adani on corruption charges and proceed against him, including arrest. We have also demanded that an independent investigation into all the other allegations should be conducted. Even in the Hindenburg revelations, he was defended. It is directly Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government led by him who have extended protection and defended Adani personally… It is a shame for our country that it is the United States of America’s Justice Department which has collected all this information because it believes that US Companies were misled,” Karat was quoted as saying.\n\n“They are protecting the interests of their companies from this fraud by Adani. Whereas the government of India, led by PM Modi is protecting him and his companies and giving him permission, license, and patronage to loot India and India’s resources… What are you saying about India to the rest of the world? That this government is protecting the most corrupt entities? This is a time when it is in India’s interest that this man be booked immediately under corruption charges. And along with that, an independent investigative agency to look into all the other issues,” she added.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi: On US prosecutors charging Gautam Adani and others in alleged Solar Energy contract bribery case, CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat says, \"We have demanded to book Adani on corruption charges and proceed against him, including arrest. We have also demanded that an… pic.twitter.com/vTXhCoNB7Q — ANI (@ANI) November 21, 2024\n\nCommenting on the issue, BJP leader Sambit Patra then said that the company would defend itself and the law would take its course. “Today, since morning, we have been seeing in the media an issue regarding a company. There is a case against that company in the US. There are allegations and counter-allegations. We believe that as far as the company and the case against it are concerned, the company will issue a statement and defend itself on its own. The law will take its course,” Patra said while addressing a press conference.\n\nभाजपा मुख्यालय में आयोजित एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रेसवार्ता को संबोधित करते हुए | Watch Live https://t.co/VkeSM4aGES — Sambit Patra (@sambitswaraj) November 21, 2024\n\nHe also slammed Congress President Rahul Gandhi for sensationalizing the issue unnecessarily. This was after Gandhi targeted Adani and the BJP government and demanded the industrialist’s arrest based on the allegations by an American probe agency.\n\n“Today, Rahul Gandhi again showed the same behaviour and presented the topic as he used to present. This isn’t new. He has used the same names and the same ways through which he tried to put a new allegation on PM Modi. He always tries to sensationalize things and describe them in a way that how big the matter is. He did the same before 2019 when he raised the issue of Rafael fighter planes, he claimed that a big revelation would be made, this topic has geared momentum in the whole world, ‘Chowkidar Chor Hai’, etc… During the COVID 19, he used to do press conferences in the same way, but at the end, he had to go to the Supreme Court and apologize… It’s his way to attack the structure of India and the people who save it,” Patra said slamming Gandhi over the issue.\n\nIt is however, crucial to note that the Adani Group has strongly refuted bribery allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of the Adani Green. “As stated by the US Department of Justice, ‘the charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.’ All possible legal recourse will be sought,” the statement by Adani stated.",

		"title": "Russia's hits Ukraine's Dnipro with hypersonic ballistic missile in response to ATACM attack: What it means",
		"text": "In what would be the first use of such a potent nuclear-capable weapon in the more than 1,000-day war Ukraine Air Force claimed on Thursday (21st November) that Russia had fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) towards the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, responded to the Ukrainian Air Force’s allegations by saying that Russia launched a hypersonic medium-range ballistic missile attack on a Ukrainian military installation, demonstrating Moscow’s capacity to target any nation whose armed forces were used against Russia.\n\nRussia launched a new experimental ballistic missile with multiple warheads, hitting a major Ukrainian city. Putin said the unprecedented attack was in response to U.S. and British missiles used against its forces. @IanPannell has details. https://t.co/wjzwJcHX65 pic.twitter.com/ayaiHrMwDM — World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) November 22, 2024\n\nPresident Putin said, “In response to the use of American and British long-range weapons, on November 21 of this year, the Russian armed forces launched a combined strike on one of the facilities of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. In combat conditions, one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was tested, among other things. In this case, with a ballistic missile in a nuclear-free hypersonic equipment.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the use of the new missile “a clear and severe escalation” in the war and demanded strong global condemnation. According to one US official quoted by Reuters, Russia warned Washington right before the strike, while another said the US had briefed Kyiv and allies on the possibility of using such a weapon.\n\nUkraine first suggested that Russia fired an intercontinental ballistic missile, a weapon designed for long-range nuclear strikes that had never been used in warfare. However, US authorities and NATO confirmed Putin’s classification of the weapon as an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a lesser range of 3,000-5,500 kilometres (1,860-3,415 miles).\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine fired 6 missiles into Russian territory. As per the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region. It was followed by British Storm Shadow missiles. The Ministry further stated that the Russian military shot down five Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more. This came after US President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to fire American-made missiles supplied to the East European country into Russia. Russia had said that Ukraine’s use of the ATACMS, the longest-range missiles supplied by Washington, was a clear indication that the West intended to intensify the conflict.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, reacting to the development, said that the United States is “throwing oil on the fire” with the decision. Accusing outgoing President Joe Biden of increasing tensions with this decision, Peskov said, “If such a decision has been taken, it means a whole new spiral of tension and a whole new situation with regard to US involvement in this conflict”. Peskov also said that such a decision by the Biden administration signals NATO’s direct involvement in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nHypersonic missile strike on Dnipro: What it means\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has been creating concerns of a potential nuclear escalation since the day it started. The outgoing US President allowing Ukraine to fire American-supplied long-range missiles into Russian territory, barely weeks before he has to vacate his office for a new President, had effectively taken the war closer to becoming a nuclear conflict. Russia responded soon after with a major change in its nuclear doctrine, including a clause that would allow it to attack non-nuclear nations with nuclear weapons.\n\nVisuals of the recent hypersonic missile attack on Dnipro show multiple hits and blasts. As per Putin’s press briefing, it was the latest Oreshnik missile system that Russia used for ‘combat testing’ on Ukraine, displaying that they are capable of hitting anywhere in Ukraine with nuclear weapons and they have a missile system that can evade the defence systems deployed in Ukraine. They are not officially NATO defence systems, but they have been supplied by NATO nations. Plainly speaking, Putin meant that the Oreshnik did not contain a nuclear warhead this time, but it could have. This was Russia demonstrating that they are capable of hitting Ukraine, or any other European capital, with nuclear warheads.\n\nUkrainian media claim that it took less than five minutes for the Russian ballistic missile to fly 790 kilometres and hit Yuzhmash plant in the city of Dnipro.\n\n\n\nBy doing this, the Kremlin is demonstrating what a nuclear strike against anywhere in Europe could look like. It is… pic.twitter.com/g4kdPtNy4C — Leonid Ragozin (@leonidragozin) November 21, 2024\n\nVideos of the blast on Dnipro showed multiple strikes. Reuters quoted Oslo-based missile tech expert Fabian Hoffman saying that the multiple strikes mean the missile was carrying MIRVed(Multiple Independently targetable Re-entry Vehicle) payload. The payload is exclusively associated with nuclear missiles. Ukrainian airforce has reported that the missile originated from Astrakhan in Russia, 700 km away from Dnipro.\n\nThe recent escalations, triggered by the Biden administration, also mean that when Donald Trump assumes office, he will have a difficult time to fulfill his promise of stopping the war. Trump has vocally criticised the relentless spending of US taxpayers’ dollars for sending military aid to Ukraine and fuelling a war.",

Latest reports from the area are saying that the death toll has risen to 44 after many injured persons eventually succumbed.\n\nStation House Officer of Ahmady Shama, Kaleem Shah, confirmed the death toll and the number of people who got injured, which included three women, the Dawn reported.\n\nUpdate: 🔊\n\nDeath toll in #Kurram attacks has risen to 44 (40 Shias and 4 Sunnis). Victims include women & children.\n\n\n\nProtesters in Parachinar questioned #Pakistan government and security as the passenger convoy was attacked while traveling under the protection of FC and Police. pic.twitter.com/gKCnujXCn2 — Bashir Ahmad Gwakh (@bashirgwakh) November 21, 2024\n\nLocal reports say that most of the passengers in the convoy were Shia Muslims from Parchinar, and the convoy, despite being under the protection of police and the Army, was attacked by some Sunni militant groups as it entered Sunni-majority villages. Some independent reports stated that the death toll could be much higher. Viral videos on social media are displaying badly damaged vans with injured and deceased persons lying scattered.\n\nPakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, while speaking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, also confirmed the same figures, describing the attack as part of a troubling series of incidents in recent days.\n\n“This past week has been difficult and upsetting; now 38 people have been martyred in Kurram,” Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said. He assured that authorities were in close contact with provincial officials, emphasising that the government would support Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in any way possible, the Dawn reported.\n\n“We see a new incident every day now and are in constant contact with the KP authorities, the KP inspector general of police, and the chief minister. They need help,” Naqvi said.\n\n“They are one of our provinces, a part of our country, and we will not leave them behind…We are going to help however we can,” he added.\n\nAccording to KP government spokesperson Barrister Saif, the attack began with an assault on police personnel before targeting the passenger convoy from both sides. The convoy reportedly consisted of around 200 vehicles, Saif said. He said that the area was attended by district officials, senior police officers, and emergency responders, and an investigation is currently underway, the Dawn reported.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Kurram Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud suggested that while sectarian violence had occurred in the region before, the targeting of civilians in this attack raised the possibility of terrorism.\n\nEarlier, the medical superintendent at Alizai Hospital, Dr Muhammad Ishaq, reported 33 fatalities and 30 injuries, with many of the injured being referred to hospitals in the district and others transferred to Peshawar.\n\nPakistan President Asif Ali Zardari described the assault on innocent passengers as a “cowardly and inhumane” act and called for swift punishment of those responsible.\n\n“Attacking innocent passengers is a cowardly and inhumane act,” he quoted in a post on X by Pakistan Peoples Party’s media cell.\n\n“The President stressed on the need to provide timely medical aid to the injured and take action against those responsible,” the post further read.\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack, stressing the importance of providing the best medical care to the injured and promising to identify and punish the perpetrators.\n\n“The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens, which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted…The evil elements involved in the incident will be identified and punished accordingly. Saboteurs cannot demoralise the brave Pakistani nation by such cowardly actions,” Sharif said, as reported by Dawn.\n\nKP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur also condemned the attack and dispatched a delegation to Kurram to assess the situation.\n\nLast month, two terrorists were killed in an operation in North Waziristan, and 12 security personnel were killed in a checkpost attack in Bannu.\n\n\n\n(With inputs from ANI)",

		"text": "On Thursday (21st November), the Consulate General of India in Toronto informed that it had to cancel some consular camps after Canadian security agencies, at the behest of the Trudeau government, denied it ‘minimum security’.\n\nIn a statement, the Indian consulate stated, “Due to continued inability conveyed by security agencies to provide minimum security against heightened threats, Consulate has had to cancel some more consular camps. Most of them were not at any places of worship, including one at a Police facility.”\n\n“Consulate is fully sensitive to the difficulties faced by close to 4,000 elderly members of the diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area- both Indian and Canadian nationals- who have been deprived of an essential consular service,” it further emphasised.\n\nUPDATE ON CONSULAR CAMPS:\n\nDue to continued inability conveyed by security agencies to provide minimum security against heightened threats, Consulate has had to cancel some more consular camps.

		"text": "On Wednesday, 20th November, the Uttar Pradesh Police arrested an individual identified as Mohammed Zahid for forcing a Hindu minor student into marriage and conversion. The accused is a teacher at a college and it is believed that he molested a minor girl forcing her to convert her religion to Islam.\n\nZahid also offered her Rs 1 lakh and threatened to fail her in the college exams for not cooperating with him. The accused has been booked under relevant sections of the law and has been arrested by the Police.\n\nAccording to media reports, Mohammed Zahid taught mathematics at National Inter College in Mandi Dhanaura area of ​​Amroha district. He expressed his ‘love’ for one of his Hindu minor students and tried to force her to marry him. Zahid also asked her to convert her religion and molested her for refusing to accept his proposal. The girl, notably, was a class 9 student.\n\nThe matter came to light after the Hindu student complained about the teacher at her home. She said that she was molested and was forced to marry and convert her religion to Islam. Following this, the family members initially informed the college principal about the teacher but no action was initiated. Zahid, however, continued with his misbehavior.\n\nHe again did obscene acts with the minor student inside the class. He then offered her Rs 1 lakh and continued to pressure her to marry him. He also threatened her that she would be failed in the college exams if she failed to accept his proposal.\n\nAfter this, the family members of the Hindu girl contacted the police. They also organised massive protests in the college demanding strict punishment for Zahid. He, meanwhile, attempted to flee from the spot but the police apprehended the accused at the right time.\n\nA case has been registered against Zahid under several sections including POCSO. The college management has also suspended him. Further investigations are underway.",

Some of the Indira canteens that cater to the poor have even closed.\n\nThe supply of breakfast, lunch and dinner in several Indira Canteens has been suspended since 20th November. The canteens that feed the hungry are unable to provide meals. As a result, many are returning without food. Due to six months of unpaid salaries, the canteen employees are not on duty which has resulted in this development.\n\nIndira Canteens at Malleshwaram, Nandinilayout in the West Zone are not giving out food. Hundreds of staff employed there have not received their salaries. Chef Talk Food and Hospitality Services is the company that supplies food to Indira Canteens in Bengaluru. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) did not make payment to the company which resulted in the present situation. The staff are also distressed as they are not getting their salaries.\n\nThe canteens at Mantri Mall Road, Subhash Nagar, Near Majestic Metro Station, Gandhinagar, Palace Nagar, Circle Maramma Temple Yeshwanthpur Road, and Malleshwaram have been shut.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shanthi Kumar also slammed the ruling Congress government and wrote, “Indira Canteens are shutting down, with 11 closed in July over Rs 47 crore unpaid bills and many shut for 6 months due to unpaid salaries.

The company Chef Talk, which had a one-year contract to provide meals to the canteens, charged that the BBMP had not paid bills totaling around Rs 65 crore. According to Chef Talk, lunch services were suspended since the BBMP failed to fulfill the invoices in spite of repeated demands. The affected canteens were located in Basavanagudi, Padmanabhanagar, Bhairasandra, VV Puram, Siddapura, Hombegowda Nagar, Jayanagar, Vidyapeetha, Ejipura and Adugodi wards.\n\nIndira Canteen is a food subsidisation programme run by the Ministry of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer affairs, Government of Karnataka. The program is inspired from the Amma Unavagam of Tamil Nadu. It is named after former Prime Minister late Indira Gandhi.",

		"text": "महाराष्ट्र विधानसभा चुनावों में महायुति (बीजेपी, शिंदे गुट की शिवसेना और अजित पवार की एनसीपी) ने प्रचंड जीत दर्ज कर इतिहास रच दिया है। 288 सीटों वाली विधानसभा में महायुति ने 200 से अधिक सीटें जीती हैं। अकेले भाजपा ने 127 सीटों पर बढ़त बनाई है, जबकि शिंदे गुट की शिवसेना 55 और अजित पवार की एनसीपी 37 सीटों पर आगे है।\n\nयह जीत न केवल महायुति के लिए ऐतिहासिक है, बल्कि विपक्ष के लिए करारी शिकस्त भी है। वहीं, हार से बौखलाए विपक्षी नेता ईवीएम, सरकार और पूंजीपतियों पर दोष मढ़ते नजर आ रहे हैं। संजय राउत ने तो इसे जनता पर ‘थोपा गया नतीजा’ तक बता दिया। यही नहीं, सपा से एनसीपी-शरद पवार में आए फवाद अहमद की एक्ट्रेस बीवी स्वरा भास्कर ने तो ईवीएम पर ही उंगली उठा दी और मशीन में खराबी का घिसा-पिटा राग अलापने लगी।\n\nमहाविकास आघाड़ी की हार के साथ ही सामने आई बौखलाहट\n\nमहायुति की प्रचंड जीत ने महाविकास आघाड़ी (एमवीए) को हिलाकर रख दिया है। आघाड़ी सिर्फ 55 सीटों तक सिमटती दिख रही है। हार से आहत एमवीए के नेता अब हार के लिए बाहरी कारणों को जिम्मेदार ठहराने लगे हैं। शिवसेना (उद्धव गुट) के सांसद संजय राउत ने नतीजों पर सवाल उठाते हुए कहा, “यह जनता का फैसला नहीं हो सकता। पूरी मशीनरी का दुरुपयोग हुआ है।” उन्होंने अडानी के नाम का जिक्र करते हुए भाजपा पर भ्रष्टाचार के मामलों से ध्यान भटकाने का आरोप भी लगाया।\n\nराउत ने कहा, “शिंदे के सारे उम्मीदवार कैसे जीत सकते हैं? यह नतीजे जनता पर थोपे गए हैं।” उन्होंने लाडकी बहन योजना का मजाक उड़ाते हुए कहा, “यहाँ लाडले नाना, दादा और भाई हैं। असली जनता का मन ऐसा नहीं हो सकता।”\n\n#WATCH | Mumbai | As Mahayuti has crossed halfway mark in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena UBT leader Sanjay Raut says, \"This cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra.

Lol! pic.twitter.com/z5SshleHCB — Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) November 20, 2024\n\nलोग जैसे अन्य मुद्दों पर चर्चा शुरू करते हैं वैसे ही इस पर भी हुई। पहले और अब की तस्वीरों में सामने आए फर्क पर गौर कराया गया। उसी में कुछ लोग ऐसे भी थे जिन्होंने इस तस्वीर को इस एंगल से देखा कि एक मुस्लिम से शादी से पहले स्वरा कैसी थीं और अब कैसी हो गई हैं।\n\nस्वरा भास्कर को बस यही बात नहीं पसंद आई और उन्होंने एक तरफ आँख मूँदकर उन्हें ट्रोल करने वाले हर शख्स को ऐसे तंज भरे अंदाज में संघी लिखा जैसे संघी कोई अपशब्द हो और दूसरी तरफ अपने शौहर का बचाव किया कि वो कोई रूढ़िवादी मुसलमान नहीं है। अपनी मॉर्डन ड्रेस दिखाकर ये साबित करने की कोशिश की कि उनका शौहर तो एक प्रोग्रेसिव मुसलमान है जो उन्हें बैकलेस, नेकलेस, स्लीवलेस ड्रेस पहनने देता है।\n\nअब फहाद क्या है, कैसे हैं… बहस का मुद्दा ये नहीं है। असल चर्चा ये हैं कि आखिर स्वरा भास्कर क्या हो गई हैं। स्वरा एक तरफ तो अपने शौहर के प्रोग्रेसिव होने के दावे अपनी वेस्टर्न ड्रेस में फोटो दिखाकर कर रही हैं और दूसरी तरफ वो अपने शौहर के लिए इस्लामी मौलानाओं से भेंट कर रही हैं और फिर मुस्लिम भीड़ के बीच जाकर मुस्लिमों से मजहब के नाम पर न सिर्फ वोट माँग रही हैं बल्कि उनको उकसाने का काम भी कर रही हैं।\n\nस्वरा की एक वीडियो वायरल है। देख सकते हैं कि ये चुनावी रैली की है। इसमें वो उसी सुर और शब्दों में बात कर रही हैं जो इस्लामी कट्टरपंथियों की रैली में होता है। स्वरा अपने भाषण में मुस्लिमों को समझाती हैं कि वो गलती से भी उन ‘गुस्ताखों’ को समर्थन न दें जिन्होंने कभी ईशनिंदा की हो।\n\nविकास के मुद्दों को साइड में रखकर अपने भाषण में वो दीन, ईमान की बातें करके भीड़ को इंप्रेस करती हैं और कहती हैं कि वो हिंदू घर में जन्मी, मुस्लिम लड़की से शादी की, लेकिन उन्हें बस कहना ये है कि ‘हजूर पाक’ केै प्रति मन में इज्जत होने के लिए जरूरी नहीं कि इंसान किस जाति में पैदा हुआ हो। उनका इस्लामी शब्दावलियों से भरा ये भाषण सुन सारे मुस्लिम इतने खुश हुए कि स्वरा का उत्साह तालियाँ बजाकर बढ़ाते रहे और स्वरा बोलती रहीं।\n\n#SwaraBhasker has grown from being a nincompoop to a hate speech giver.\n\n\n\nI always wonder how a liberal #feminist atheist woman completely turns into a rabid Jihadi.\n\nBeing brainless seems to be the necessary condition. pic.twitter.com/6B0o3OBKW8 — ShoneeKapoor (@ShoneeKapoor) November 18, 2024\n\nवीडियो देखने के बाद आपको कहीं से भी नहीं लगेगा कि स्वरा एक सेकुलर हैं या कभी एक हिंदू रहीं होगीं। उनका इस्लाम के प्रति गहरा झुकाव उनके लहजे से साफ दिखता है। इसके अलावा उनकी एक तस्वीर सामने आई है जिसमें वो मौलाना सज्जाद नोमानी के साथ दिख रही है। इस तस्वीर को देख भी अंदाजा लगाया जा सकता है कि एक समय में देश के संविधान की बात करके मुस्लिमों के लिए अधिकार माँगने वाली स्वरा पूरी करह इस्लामी ताकतों के आगे सरेंडर कर चुकी हैं।उन्हें इस बात से भी कोई मतलब नहीं है कि जिस व्यक्ति से वो मिल रही हैं उसके विचार क्या हैं।\n\nFeminist Swara Bhasker took blessings from Maulana Sajjad Nomani, who praised the Taliban for its capture of Afghanistan and opposed women's education, even claiming that it is 'haram' for parents to send their daughters to school or college unsupervised. pic.twitter.com/dDkAE4jH73 — Anshul Saxena (@AskAnshul) November 17, 2024\n\nउन्होंने कोई लेना-देना नहीं है कि सज्जाद नोमानी तो वही मौलाना है जो खुलेआम तालिबानी शासन का समर्थन करते है, तालिबानियों को सलाम भेजते हैं, लड़कियों को स्कूल-कॉलेज न भेजने की वकालत करते हैं, मुस्लिमों को हिंदुओं के खिलाफ भड़काते हैं, भगवा लव ट्रैप जैसा प्रोपगेंडा बनाकर RSS को बदनाम करते हैं और भाजपा का हुक्का-पानी बंद करने की बात करते हैं।\n\nस्वरा को मतलब है जो सिर्फ मुस्लिम वोटों से, शौहर के करियर को चमकाने से और इस्लाम को केंद्र में रखकर राजनीति करने से। वो न अब सोशल मीडिया पर खुद को फेमिनिस्ट दिखा पा रही हैं, न सेकुलर, और न हिंदू। वो खुलकर सिर्फ ये बता रही हैं उनके लिए अब इस्लाम ही सब कुछ है और उसका बचाव करना ही उनका उद्देश्य। उनकी इस जद्दोजहद में भले ही फहाद एक कट्टर-मुस्लिम न लग रहे हों, लेकिन वो कट्टर इस्लाम समर्थक होने की छवि जरूर बना रही है। सोशल मीडिया ट्रोलर्स भी उनका यही रूप देखकर उनके पहले के रूप में और अब में तुलना कर रहे हैं।",

		"title": "राहुल गाँधी से यासीन मलिक की बीवी ने यूँ ही नहीं माँगी मदद, मनमोहन सरकार ने दिया था 'लाड़'",
		"text": "आतंकी गतिविधियों को जम्मू-कश्मीर में अंजाम तक पहुँचाने के लिए कु्ख्यात ‘जम्मू-कश्मीर लिबरेशन फ्रंट’ का आतंकी यासीन मलिक जेल में बेचैन है। उसने जेल के भीतर अमानवीय व्यवहार का इल्जाम लगाकर भूख हड़ताल शुरू की है और बाहर उसकी पाकिस्तानी बीवी मुशाल दर दर भटकर उसके लिए रहम माँग रही है। इसी क्रम में हाल में यासीन की पत्नी ने हाल में कॉन्ग्रेस नेता राहुल गाँधी को चिट्ठी लिखी और बताया कि यासीन एक अहिंसक आदमी है और इस भूख हड़ताल से उसकी सेहत पर प्रतिकूल प्रभाव पड़ सकता है।\n\nअपने पत्र में मुशाल ने राहुल गाँधी को सम्मान देते हुए अपना दर्द सुनाया। इसमें कहा गया एनआईए ने यासीन के खिलाफ मौत की माँग की है और 2019 से केंद्र सरकार यासीन को अकल्पनीय तरीकों से प्रताड़ित कर रही है।\n\nमुशाल ने शिकायत की मलिक पर 35 साल पुराने मामले में भारत के खिलाफ युद्ध छेड़ने का मुकदमा चलाया जा रहा है और अब एनआईए उसके खिलाफ दर्ज मनगढ़ंत मामलों में उसके लिए मौत की सजा की माँग कर रहा है।\n\nमुशाल ने राहुल गाँधी से आग्रह किया कि वो संसद में अपने उच्च नैतिक और राजनीतिक प्रभाव का इस्तेमाल करें और यासीन मलिक के मामले पर एक चर्चा शुरू करें। वो जम्मू कश्मीर में ‘दिखावटी’ नहीं, बल्कि वास्तविक शांति कायम करने का जरिया बन सकता है।\n\nअब आगे बढ़ने से पहले बता देते हैं कि जिस यासीन मलिक को मुशाल शांति का दूत बता रही हैं उस पर असल में इल्जाम क्या-क्या हैं।\n\nयासीन मलिक पर केस कोई एक मामले पर नहीं चल रहा है। उसके आतंक से जुड़े होने का इतिहास काफी पुराना है। 1989-1990 के बीच जब इस्लामी कट्टरपंथियों ने घाटी से कश्मीरी पंडितों का नरसंहार शुरू किया तब यासीन मलिक का नाम उन हत्यारों में शामिल था जिन्होंने चुन-चुन कर कश्मीरी पंडितों को निशाना बनाया।\n\nइसके अलावा उसके ऊपर 1990 में वायुसेना के चार जवानों की हत्या का भी आरोप है जिसे उसने मीडिया में खुद स्वीकार किया हुआ है। यासीन पर कश्मीरी पंडित न्यायाधीश न्यायमूर्ति नीलकंठ गंजू की हत्या सहित कई अन्य गंभीर अपराधों में संलिप्तता का भी आरोप लगा हुआ है।\n\nइतना ही नहीं आज उसपर जो मुकदमे चल रहे हैं वो उसके कुकर्मों का परिणाम हैं। उसपर घाटी में आतंक गतिविधियों को अंजाम देने के साथ, आतंकियों के लिए धन जुटाने और देश के खिलाफ य़ुद्ध छेड़ने के भी आरोप हैं।\n\nअब सवाल है कि यदि यासीन इतना कुख्यात रहा है तो फिर उसकी बीवी किस आधार पर जाकर राहुल गाँधी से यासीन का मुद्दा उठाने की बात कर रही है। तो बता दें कि इस बिंदु को समझने के लिए उस दौर में जाना पड़ेगा जब सत्ता कॉन्ग्रेस की थी और प्रधानमंत्री खुद यासीन का स्वागत करते थे।\n\n1990 में घाटी में खून-खराबा करने का दोषी 2006 में अचानक कॉन्ग्रेस का प्यारा बन गया था। खुद प्रधानमंत्री मनमोहन सिंह ने यासीन मलिक को नई दिल्ली में पीएम आवास पर बुलाया था और कई मुद्दों पर उससे चर्चा की थी। आज भी यासीन मलिक के साथ पूर्व पीएम मनमोहन सिंह की मुस्कुराती फोटो, वीडियो आपको वायरल होती मिल जाएगी।\n\nइस मुलाकात का असर ये हुआ था कि यासीन मलिक को प्रमुख मीडिया संस्थानों के बड़े-बड़े कार्यक्रमों में बुद्धिजीवी बनाकर लाया जाने लगा। 2008 के इंडिया टुडे कॉन्क्लेव में यासीन को यूथ आईकन बनाकर पेश किया गया था। वहीं साल 2013 में एनडीटीवी ने यासीन मलिक को उसका पक्ष तक रखने का मंच दिया था और इस दौरान रवीर कुमार यासीन मलिक को ‘साहब’ और ‘यस सर’, ‘जी सर’ कहते नजर सुनाई पड़े थे।\n\nIndia Today Conclave 2008 mentioned: Yasin Malik is a strong advocate for the right of return of Kashmiri Hindus. But so called secular Yasin Malik protested against the colonies of Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir valley in 2015. He also assaulted India Today's Journalist in 2017. pic.twitter.com/eWDQJTg4mL\n\nयासीन को आतंकी मानने का सिलसिला तो शुरू ही मोदी सरकार के आने के बाद हुआ और उसकी गिरफ्तारी 2017 में जाकर हुई थी। उस समय राष्ट्रीय जाँच एजेंसी (NIA) ने कश्मीर घाटी में आतंकवादी गतिविधियों के लिए धन जुटाने के मामले में उसे पकड़ा था और फिर उसे टेरर फंडिंग से संबंधित मामलों में आरोपित बनाया गया। इसके बाद, 19 मई 2022 को एक विशेष अदालत ने उसे विभिन्न आरोपों के तहत दोषी ठहराया।\n\nYasin Malik meanwhile has been slapped with Public Safety Act (PSA) by J&K Police and shifted to Jammu’s Kot Balwal Jail from Srinagar where he was detained on Feb 22nd. Logical move. Can you imagine a terrorist/killer roaming free for last three decades without any fear of law? pic.twitter.com/YP9d9V30kQ",

		"text": "भारतीय कारोबारी समूह अडानी ग्रुप पर अमेरिका के न्याय न्यायिक विभाग और सिक्युरिटीज एक्सचेंज बोर्ड ने भ्रष्टाचार का आरोप लगाया है। अमेरिकी एजेंसियों के अनुसार, अडानी समूह ने भारतीय सरकारी अधिकारियों को रिश्वत दी और इसके जरिए पेश की गई झूठी तस्वीर से समूह ने अमेरिका में निवेशकों से पैसा लिया।\n\nअमेरिकी एजेंसियों ने अडानी समूह के मुखिया गौतम अडानी समेत 7 लोगों को इस मामले में आरोपित बनाया है। इस मामले में कॉन्ग्रेस नेता जयराम रमेश ने भारत सरकार को घेरा है। भाजपा आईटी सेल प्रमुख अमित मालवीय ने मुकदमे के कागजों के सहारे ही उनके तथ्यों की बखिया उधेड़ी है और कहा है कि इतनी जल्दी अंतिम निष्कर्ष पर ना पहुँचा जाए।\n\nअडानी पर बुधवार (20 नवम्बर, 2024) को लगाए गए आरोपों के बाद कॉन्ग्रेस के राज्यसभा सांसद और मीडिया प्रमुख जयराम रमेश ने मोर्चा संभाला। जयराम रमेश ने गुरुवार (22 नवम्बर, 2024) को एक्स (पहले ट्विटर) के माध्यम से अडानी समूह और सरकार को घेरा।\n\nजयराम रमेश ने लिखा, “गौतम अडानी, सागर अडानी और अन्य के खिलाफ अमेरिकी अटॉर्नी कार्यालय, ईस्टर्न डिस्ट्रिक्ट ऑफ़ न्यूयॉर्क द्वारा चालू किए गए मुकदमे में अडानी की आपराधिक गतिविधियों के बारे में चौंकाने वाली जानकारी सामने आई है। इसमें आरोप लगाया गया है कि उन्होंने 2020 से 2024 के बीच भारत के सरकारी अधिकारियों को 250 मिलियन डॉलर (₹2100 करोड़) से अधिक की रिश्वत दी गई।”\n\nजयराम रमेश ने आगे लिखा, “मुकदमे में कहा गया है कि रिश्वत ‘भारत सरकार के साथ सोलर एनर्जी सप्लाई करने का टेंडर लेने के लिए दी गई थी। इस टेंडर के मिलने से 2 बिलियन डॉलर (₹16,800 करोड़) से अधिक का मुनाफ़ा होने होता। इसी मुकदमे में कहा गया है कि कई मौकों पर गौतम अडानी ने अपनी रिश्वत की योजना को और आगे बढ़ाने के लिए व्यक्तिगत रूप से एक सरकारी अधिकारी से मुलाकात की, जिसका इलेक्ट्रॉनिक और फोन सबूत होने का दावा किया गया है।”\n\nअडानी पर हमला करते हुए जयराम रमेश ने आरोप लगाया कि उन्हें मोदी सरकार संरक्षण दे रही है। उन्होंने माँग की कि भारत में भी अडानी समूह के ऑपरेशन की जाँच करने के लिए नए SEBI मुखिया की नियुक्ति की जाए और साथ ही एक संयुक्त संसदीय समिति (JPC) का गठन किया जाए।\n\nजयराम रमेश के इन आरोपों का जवाब भाजपा आईटी सेल के मुखिया अमित मालवीय ने दिया। अमित मालवीय ने अमेरिकी कोर्ट के कागजों के हवाले से लिखा, “इसलिए कहते हैं कि जवाबा देने से पहले पढ़ लेना चाहिए। आपने जिन कागजों हवाला दिया है। उन्हीं में लिखा है, “मुकदमे में लगाए गए आरोप अभी सिद्ध नहीं हुए हैं और जब तक आरोपित दोषी साबित न हो जाएँ, तब तक उन्हें निर्दोष करार माना जाता है।” इसके बाद मालवीय ने इस मुकदमे के कागजों के सहारे कॉन्ग्रेस को ही कठघरे में खड़ा कर दिया।\n\nIt is always good to read before one reacts. The document you quote says, “The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”\n\n\n\nBut be as it may, the essence of the charge is that US and Indian companies agreed… https://t.co/Y3UivigtTx pic.twitter.com/MkMri2fPQs",

Today the #AssamCabinet has fulfilled this long standing demand of our people. pic.twitter.com/VSN8Bnyv8N\n\nकरीमगंज जिला जिसका अब नाम श्रीभूमि कर दिया गया है, वो बांग्लादेश के बॉर्डर पर है। यहाँ बांग्ला बोलने वालों की आबादी सबसे ज्यादा है। अंग्रेजों के समय यह सिलहट जिले का हिस्सा हुआ करता था। बँटवारे के बाद सिलहट का कुछ हिस्सा पाकिस्तान (अब का बांग्लादेश) में चला गया, कुछ भारत की ओर रहा। यही हिस्सा अब श्रीभूमि जिले के नाम से जाना जाएगा।\n\nGlad to see the celebration in Sribhumi district.\n\n\n\nIts erstwhile name-Karimganj, had no reasonance with either Assamese or Bengali sentiments. Sribhumi is a fitting tribute to the region’s ancient Sanskriti. https://t.co/y3F7iJpOXS",

		"text": "जम्मू में कश्मीरी पंडित प्रवासियों की दुकानों पर जम्मू विकास प्राधिकरण (JDA) का बुलडोज़र चलने से बवाल खड़ा हो गया। बुधवार (20 नवंबर 2024) को JDA ने मुठी इलाके में करीब एक दर्जन दुकानों को ध्वस्त कर दिया। ये दुकानें उन कश्मीरी पंडित परिवारों की थीं जिन्हें तीन दशक पहले तत्कालीन जम्मू-कश्मीर सरकार ने यहाँ बसाया था।\n\nदुकानदारों का कहना है कि उन्हें बिना कोई पूर्व सूचना दिए कार्रवाई की गई, जबकि JDA ने इस दावे को खारिज किया है। JDA के उपाध्यक्ष पंकज शर्मा का कहना है कि प्रभावित लोगों को 20 जनवरी को नोटिस दिया गया था और उन्होंने फरवरी के अंत तक जगह खाली करने का वादा किया था। लेकिन चुनावी आचार संहिता और अन्य बाधाओं के कारण समय पर कार्रवाई नहीं हो सकी।\n\nशर्मा ने बताया कि मुठी इलाके में 25 कनाल ज़मीन थी, जहाँ कश्मीरी पंडित प्रवासियों को शुरू में एक कमरे वाले गुंबदनुमा घरों में बसाया गया था, और बाद में उन्हें पुरखू और जगती में दो कमरों वाले फ्लैटों में बसाया गया। उन्होंने कहा कि इस कदम के बाद भी कई लोगों ने शुरुआती बस्तियों को खाली नहीं किया है। चूँकि यहाँ 208 गरीबों के लिए घरों का निर्माण कराया जाना है, जिसका टेंडर भी जारी हो चुका है। ऐसे में हमें जमीन खाली करानी ही है। इसके बावजूद प्रशासन ने 10 दुकानों का इंतजाम इन लोगों के लिए किया है।\n\nइस घटना के बाद कई राजनीतिक दलों और कश्मीरी पंडित संगठनों ने सरकार की आलोचना की। घटना से जुड़े वीडियो सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे हैं। एक बुजुर्ग व्यक्ति वीडियो में रोते हुए कहते हैं, “हम सब कुछ खो चुके हैं। अब कहाँ जाएँ?”\n\nमहबूबा मुफ्ती (PDP प्रमुख) ने इसे “कश्मीरी पंडितों की दशकों की तकलीफों पर एक और चोट” बताया। उन्होंने सोशल मीडिया पर एक वीडियो साझा करते हुए कहा, “पहले आदिवासी समुदाय को निशाना बनाया गया, और अब कश्मीरी पंडितों को। यह उन्हें और अलग-थलग करने का काम करेगा।”\n\nHeartbreaking scenes emerge as Kashmiri Pandit shopkeepers stand helplessly by the rubble of their demolished shops, reportedly brought down by the JDA without prior notice. This comes as yet another blow to a community that has endured unimaginable hardships for decades. What… pic.twitter.com/jyQ1w9yPhB",

Dholera & many Indus civilisation sites are in Gujarat & over 5000 yrs old. Try to refer to multiple history books before quoting 1 book based on 1000-1800 AD (post Mughal).

		"text": "- Advertisement -\n\nમહારાષ્ટ્ર વિધાનસભા ચૂંટણી-2024 (Maharashtra Election) માટે મતદાન ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મતદાનના થોડા કલાકો પહેલાં જ વિપક્ષે ભાજપ નેતા વિનોદ તાવડે (Vinod Tawde) પર લોકોને પૈસા વહેંચવાનો આરોપ લગાવ્યો. બીજી તરફ, મહાવિકાસ આઘાડીના શરદ પવારવાળી NCPનાં નેતા અને પવારનાં પુત્રી સુપ્રિયા સુલે (Supriya Sule) પર બિટકોઈન કૌભાંડના પૈસાનો ઉપયોગ કરવાનો આરોપ લાગ્યો છે. આ બધાની વચ્ચે ઈન્ડિયા ટુડેના ‘પત્રકાર’ રાજદીપ સરદેસાઈએ (Rajdeep Sardesai) ફરી પક્ષપાતી વલણ અપનાવ્યું છે.\n\nબન્યું એવું કે મહારાષ્ટ્રના પાલઘરમાં મંગળવારે (19 નવેમ્બર) બહુજન વિકાસ આઘાડીના કાર્યકર્તાઓએ ભાજપના રાષ્ટ્રીય મહાસચિવ વિનોદ તાવડે પર મતદારોને પૈસા વહેંચવાનો આરોપ લગાવ્યો. ત્યારબાદ રાજદીપ સરદેસાઈએ આ મુદ્દે એક પછી એક ટ્વિટ્સનો મારો ચલાવ્યો. જોકે, મામલો હજુ તપાસનો વિષય છે પણ રાજદીપે પોતાનો રાજકીય ઝુકાવ કઈ તરફ છે એ પ્રદર્શિત કરવામાં ઝાઝો સમય ન લગાડ્યો.\n\nએક ટ્વિટમાં રાજદીપ લખે છે કે, “ભાજપના રાષ્ટ્રીય મહાસચિવ વિનોદ તાવડેને વિરારની એક હોટેલમાં BVAના એક ધારાસભ્યે ઘેર્યા. તેમની ઉપર 5 કરોડ રૂપિયા કૅશ ભરેલી બેગ રાખવાનો આરોપ છે. સાથે તેમની પાસે એક ડાયરી પણ છે, જેમાં જેમને પૈસા આપવામાં આવ્યા તે લોકોનાં નામ છે. ભાજપ અને BVA કાર્યકર્તાઓ વચ્ચે ઘર્ષણ પણ થયું. જો વૉટ ‘ખરીદી’ શકાય તો ચૂંટણી સ્વતંત્ર અને નિષ્પક્ષ કઈ રીતે હોય શકે? શું ચૂંટણી પંચ ફરી એક વખત તપાસ અને કાર્યવાહી કરશે કે ચૂપ રહેશે?\n\n🚨 In October 93, Rajdeep Sardesai's father was arrested for huge money laundering.

શું તેમની અંદરના વાર્તાકાર આ ઘટનાને ફિલ્મી પડદા પર ઉતારીને જનતાની સામે સત્ય ઉજાગર કરી શક્યા? 9/11થી મોટી ઘટના શું આપણા દેશમાં વાસ્તવિકતામાં બની છે? – હાં. અને આ જવાબની પાછળ જે તર્ક છુપાયેલો છે તેનાથી જ ગભરાય છે ‘સલિમા’ બનાવવા વાળી કોમ.\n\n27 ફેબ્રુઆરી 2002ના રોજ આગમાં 59 જીવતા લોકો બળીને ખાખ થઈ ગયા હતા. અને આ ઘટના 9/11 કરતા ઘણી મોટી અને વધુ ભયાનક હતી. મૃતકોની સંખ્યા આની પાછળનો તર્ક નથી. દલીલ ઘટનાને અંજામ આપનારાઓની ઓળખ અંગે છે. 9/11ને અંજામ આપનારા તમામ લોકો સમાન મજહબી માનસિકતા અને તાલીમ ધરાવતા હતા. પરંતુ સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસ ટ્રેનને (Sabarmati Express) સળગાવનારા લોકો શાકભાજી વેચનારથી લઈને દરજી કે ચિત્રકારથી લઈને મૌલવી-મૌલાના અને ભીડમાં ચાલતા કોઈ પાડોશી પણ હોઈ શકે છે, એવા લોકો જેમના પર આપણે વિશ્વાસ કરીએ છીએ.\n\nકોઈ વ્યક્તિને જીવતા સળગાવીને કેવી રીતે મારી શકે? એક સાથે 59 લોકોને કેવી રીતે જીવતા બાળી શકાય? આવા પ્રશ્નોનો જવાબ છે – જયારે નફરત મન કે હૃદયમાંથી ઉતરીને આત્મા સુધી પહોંચી જાય ત્યારે જ કોઈ આવું કરવાનું વિચારી શકે છે. ‘કાફિર’ની (Kafir) હત્યા, નરકમાં સળગાવવા વગેરે જેવી નફરત પરની મહોર કટ્ટરવાદી ઇસ્લામિક વિચારસરણીનો એક ભાગ છે જ. પરંતુ ગંગા-જમુની તહજીબ ‘સલિમા’વાળી કોમ આ નફરતને કેવી રીતે દર્શાવે, તેનું જ પરિણામ છે ‘ધ સાબરમતી રિપોર્ટ’ ફિલ્મનું 8297 દિવસ પછી એટલે કે 22 વર્ષની રાહ જોયા પછી રિલીઝ થવું.\n\n6 ફકરા અને 400થી વધુ શબ્દો પછી પણ હું ‘ધ સાબરમતી રિપોર્ટ’ની (The Sabarmati Report) સ્ક્રિપ્ટ, સંગીત, અભિનય, સિનેમેટોગ્રાફી વગેરે વિશે લખી શક્યો નથી, આ માટે માફ કરશો. પણ હું ભટક્યો પણ નથી. ખરેખર, હું આ ફિલ્મનો રિવ્યૂ (Film Review) લખવા પણ નહોતો માગતો. તેની જરૂરિયાત જ નહોતી. કેમકે મેઈનસ્ટ્રીમ મીડિયાથી (Main Stream Media) લઈને સોશિયલ મીડિયા પર એના વિષે ઘણું લખાયું છે. હું સમાજમાં આ ફિલ્મના અસ્તિત્વની આવશ્યકતા પર લખી રહ્યો છું. મને રસ એ વાતમાં છે કે આવી હૃદયદ્રાવક અને ભયાનક ઘટના, જેને ભારતીય ઇતિહાસમાંથી ક્યારેય ભુલાવી નહીં શકાય, તેના પર ફિલ્મ બનાવવામાં 22 વર્ષ કેમના લાગી ગયા.\n\nકેમ જોવી જોઈએ ‘ધ સાબરમતી રિપોર્ટ’\n\nગોધરામાં (Godhra) સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસ ટ્રેન સળગાવવામાં આવી ન હતી, પરંતુ જેમાં અયોધ્યાથી કારસેવકો આવી રહ્યા હતા એ સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસ ટ્રેન સળગાવવામાં આવી હતી. જો આ બંને બાબતો વચ્ચે તફાવત સમજવો છે – તો જુઓ ‘ધ સાબરમતી રિપોર્ટ’.\n\nગોધરામાં સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસને સળગાવવામાં માર્યા ગયેલા 59 લોકોમાંથી કેટલાકના નામ જાણવા માગો છો – તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nજો તમને એવી ઘટના વિશે જાણવામાં રસ હોય કે જેણે ભારતીય ઈતિહાસને બે ભાગમાં (ગોધરા પહેલાનું ભારત, ગોધરા પછીનું ભારત) વિભાજિત કર્યો– તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nટ્રેનમાં આગ આપમેળે નહોતી લાગી, કે ના ટેકનિકલ ખામીના લીધે લાગી હતી… પરંતુ કટ્ટરવાદી મુસ્લિમોએ આયોજનબદ્ધ રીતે લગાવી હતી, આ સત્ય મોટા પડદા પર જોવા ઈચ્છો છો – તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nમીડિયા દરેક સત્યને જેમનું તેમ જ બતાવે છે જો આ ભ્રમમાં જીવી રહ્યા છો – તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\n22 વર્ષ પછી પણ ગંગા-જમુની ‘સલિમા’વાળી કોમ જાગીને ગોધરાના સત્યને લખીને તેના પર ફિલ્મ બનાવી રહી છે, જો આ બદલાવને જોવા માંગતા હોવ – તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nકટ્ટરપંથી ઈસ્લામિક માનસિકતાના કારણે જીવતા સળગાવવામાં આવેલા 59 લોકોમાંથી અત્યાર સુધી માત્ર 41 લોકોના નામ જ જાહેર કરવામાં આવ્યા છે. બાકીના 18 અજાણ્યા લોકો કોણ હતા? આના પર મીડિયાનું ઇન્વેસ્ટીગેટીવ પત્રકારત્વ અને બોલીવુડ ‘સલિમા’ બનાવવાવાળા ક્યારે લાવશે ફિલ્મ કે ડોક્યુમેન્ટ્રી? આ સવાલ માત્ર સવાલ ન રહીને દેશનું નેરેટિવ બને, આ આવી ઈચ્છા રાખતા હોવ, જો એવું ઇચ્છતા હોવ કે આ 18 લોકો માત્ર અજ્ઞાત બનીને ન રહી જાય – તો જુઓ આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nકેમ ન જોવી જોઈએ ‘ધ સાબરમતી રિપોર્ટ’\n\nટ્રેન કેવી રીતે સળગી રહી છે, તેના વિઝ્યુઅલ જોવા માંગતા હોવ – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nજો જોવા માંગો છો કે જીવતા સળગી રહેલ લોકો કેવી ચીસો પાડી રહ્યા છે – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nજો તમે સિનેમામાં બતાવવામાં આવેલી ‘2 વાર્તાઓ’ અને વાર્તા પાછળના જુઠ્ઠાણા અને તે પછી ઉભરી આવેલી વાસ્તવિકતા વચ્ચેના તફાવતને સમજવામાં અસમર્થ હોવ તો – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nમીડિયા રિપોર્ટ્સમાં શું કહેવામાં આવ્યું અને અંતમાં સત્ય કેવી રીતે બહાર આવ્યું, આ નથી સમજી શકતા – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nપાકિસ્તાની ટીમના સિક્સર મારવા પર મુસ્લિમ કોલોનીમાં વાગતી તાળીઓ અને ફૂટતાં ફટાકડા વચ્ચે મુસલમાની ટોપી પહેરેલા નાના-નાના બાળકોના ઇન્ડિયાની જીત પર ખુશી માનવતા સીન વચ્ચેનું અંતર નથી સમજી શકતા – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nપ્રમાણિક લોકો બન્ને તરફ હોય છે, આ લાઈનનો તર્ક નથી સમજી શકતા – તો ના જોશો આ ફિલ્મ.\n\nઆ ફિલ્મ એક હિન્દી પત્રકારની આસપાસ ફરી રહી છે, પરંતુ જો શુદ્ધ હિન્દી સાથે પ્રેમ છે – તો આ ફિલ્મ ન જોશો.\n\nજે જે સીન પર વિવાદ થઇ રહ્યો છે, ત્યાં શું કહેવા માંગે છે નિર્દેશક?\n\n‘પ્રમાણિક લોકો બંને તરફ છે’ – જો તમને આ દ્રશ્યથી દુઃખ થઇ રહ્યું છે, તો એપીજે અબ્દુલ કલામ વિશે તમારા વિચારો શું છે? શું તેઓને પણ નકારવામાં આવશે? કેરળના ગવર્નર આરીફ મોહમ્મદ ખાન હાલમાં ભાજપમાં છે પરંતુ તેમણે શાહ બાનો મુદ્દે પોતાની જ કોંગ્રેસ પાર્ટી રાજીવ ગાંધીનો વિરોધ કર્યો હતો, તો શું તેઓ તેમને પણ નકારી કાઢશો? વાર્તા લેખક અને દિગ્દર્શક માત્ર એટલું જ કહેવાનો પ્રયાસ કરી રહ્યા છે કે જો કોઈ સમાજના કોઈપણ વર્ગમાં સારું હોય તો તેને સમાન દ્રષ્ટિકોણથી જોવું જોઈએ. શું તેને આટલું બધું કહેવાની કે બતાવવાની સ્વતંત્રતા પણ ન હોવી જોઈએ?\n\n‘મુસલમાની ટોપી પહેરેલા નાના-નાના બાળકોનું ઇન્ડિયાની જીત પર જશ્ન’ – ધ્યાનમાં રાખો કે આ દ્રશ્યમાં બતાવેલ બાળકો કિશોરાવસ્થા સુધી પહોંચ્યા નથી. દિગ્દર્શક બતાવવા માંગે છે કે ધાર્મિક કટ્ટરતાનું ઝેર હજુ તેમના મગજમાં ભરાયું નથી, તે નિર્દોષ છે અને ભારતની જીતનો જશ્ન મનાવી રહ્યા છે. કારણ કે એ જ ડિરેક્ટરે એ જ મુસ્લિમ કોલોનીના એ જ બાળકોના પુખ્ત પરિવારોને પાકિસ્તાની સિક્સર પર તાળીઓ પાડતા અને ફટાકડા ફોડતા પણ બતાવ્યા છે. શું તમે દ્રશ્ય માધ્યમમાં એકદમ વિપરીત સંદર્ભોને સમાનાંતર રજૂ કરીને પ્રેક્ષકોને વિચારવા માટે મજબૂર કરવાની શૈલીનો અંત લાવવા માંગો છો?\n\n‘મીડિયા રિપોર્ટ અને 2 ખોટી વાર્તાઓ’ – સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસ સળગાવવાની ઘટના બાદ મીડિયાએ જૂઠ્ઠાણું ઘડ્યું છે, આ જ નિર્દેશક કહેવાનો પ્રયાસ કરી રહ્યા છે. તમે જે મીડિયા પર વિશ્વાસ કરો છો અને તેના દ્વારા દર્શાવવામાં આવેલા વિઝ્યુઅલ્સને સત્ય તરીકે સ્વીકારો છો, તે ખુલ્લું પડી ગયું છે. આ ફિલ્મમાં સાબરમતી એક્સપ્રેસ કોણે સળગાવી એના કરતા વધુ ફોકસ છે – કોણે છુપાવ્યું? અને કોણે ષડ્યંત્ર રચ્યું એ જણાવવામાં. મીડિયા આમાં વિલેન છે – ફિલ્મની આ લાઈનમાં શું અને કેવી સમસ્યા?\n\nક્યાં કરી શકાતો હતો સુધારો\n\nશરૂઆતી ડિસ્ક્લેમરથી લઈને અંતિમ સાભારવાળા સીનમાં ઉંધી-સીધી-તૂટી-ફૂટી લખેલી હિન્દી પર ધ્યાન આપવામાં આવ્યું નથી. આ અક્ષમ્ય ત્યારે છે જયારે આખી ફિલ્મમાં મુખ્ય અભિનેતા વારંવાર પોતાને હિન્દી મિડીયમવાળો કરી રહ્યો છે, તેને હિન્દી પત્રકાર હોવા પર પણ ગર્વ છે. નિર્માતા-નિર્દેશકને વગર પૈસા ખર્ચે તેની પાસે જ પ્રૂફરીડ પણ કરાવી લેવું જોઈતું હતું, જો તેને રીલ વાળું હિન્દી રીયલમાં પણ આવડતું હોય તો.",

It seeks forfeiture of their properties.\n\nAdani forgot that US is not ruled by Modi where he could rely upon a pliant ED, SEBI& CBI to get away with anything.#Modani pic.twitter.com/G0VWQyTIUW",

		"text": "OpIndia was launched with a view to give alternative points of views and opinions a space and audience, something that the mainstream media of India not only denies but actively suppresses. The idea was to break away from the usual left-leaning narrative that dominates the opinion pieces of various publications.\n\nWith some immodesty, we can claim that we have been able to make a mark and some impact in a world dominated by the big media and celebrity journalists.\n\nMany of our articles, which gave a counter to the usual views aired by the mainstream media, have gone viral over the last year, while our documentation of “Media Lies” is a great repository that exposes the problems with the mainstream media. Also check our Fact-Check section.\n\nThis phenomenon inspired many people to approach us with their own articles where they countered the opinions and narrative being offered in the mainstream media. We published many such articles on OpIndia.com, however they were just a fraction of submissions we were getting.\n\nWe did not put every submission as sometimes we didn’t agree with the tone, sometimes with the argument, and sometimes because our publication schedule didn’t allow it.\n\nTrust us, we felt equally bad not publishing your articles as you might have felt over OpIndia not giving you an opportunity to speak your mind.\n\nTo solve this problem, we have come up with “MyVoice” – a user generated and community driven chapter of OpIndia\n\nWe don’t promise to publish everything – please refer to the guidelines here – but we promise to give most of you a space to have your say. We may not entirely agree with you, but we will let the readers decide about your arguments and opinions.\n\nPlease note that even if you want your articles to be published on the main OpIndia.com website, you have to submit them over here at “MyVoice” only. Our editorial team will routinely pick some articles that fit our requirements and publish those on main website.\n\nYou need to register at OpIndia network with a valid email address and you will get a platform to air your views. Please read this on details about how to submit your articles for review. Do also check these frequently asked questions.\n\nSo speak up, we’re listening!",

		"title": "Editorial guidelines for contributing articles to MyVoice and OpIndia",
		"text": "By default, these are also the guidelines for contributing articles to the main English and Hindi websites of OpIndia. Broadly, your contributions should meet the following criteria:\n\n1. The article should be original and not published anywhere at the time of submission, except on your personal blog. If we find that the idea was lifted from any other place, we will credit the original author and put your contacts out in public.\n\n2. The article shouldn’t be too short, say less than 300 words, or too long, say over 1500 words (we might relax the upper limit in rare cases, but don’t take that chance!).\n\n3. If the article is a curated news report, it should cite original sources. Don’t copy-paste sentences even if you are curating. Your curation should add value to the original reports. Ideally it should give a new insight or analysis by combining information from different sources.\n\n4. We will prefer articles that deal with current events that are making headlines at that point of time.\n\n5. You will be entirely liable for opinion pieces. So please research well for data and information before making claims and conclusions.\n\n6. The opinion pieces could be about individuals or entities, but it should not contain ad-hominem attacks. You can talk about someone’s personal life only if it’s directly related to the topic you are touching in your opinion piece.\n\n7. No defamatory or abusive content will be allowed, no matter how strong or justified your emotions or arguments are.\n\n8. We won’t entertain the usual left-liberal narrative. We are for free speech, but we are not obliged to carry such articles. Internet is a free space and you will get lot many platforms to voice your opinion. The mainstream media in India loves the left-liberal narrative, and we don’t want to mirror the mainstream media. We will stick to a right-liberal narrative.\n\n9. We are not averse to touching politically incorrect themes, but the final decision regarding the tone and tenor of the article rests with our editorial team. You may push boundaries, but we will stick to some limits as set by the laws of the land and our own editorial policies.\n\nThe submitted articles will be reviewed and moderated, and published by our editorial team if they meet the aforementioned criteria. A few selected ones that further meet our editorial preferences and requirements will be transferred from “MyVoice” to the main website.",

		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions about article submissions to OpIndia",
		"text": "Q1. How long will it take for my submission to be approved or rejected?\n\nPlease give us time of two working days, although we will try to take a final call on moderation earlier than that. If your contribution is pending even after two working days, please get in touch with us through email giving relevant details.\n\nQ2. Why was my submission rejected/deleted?\n\nAlthough we try to publish as many submissions as we get, we may reject some if they don’t meet the editorial guidelines mentioned here. Please make sure that your article meets the guidelines before submitting it for review.\n\nQ3. Why was my article not published on the main OpIndia English or Hindi websites?\n\nPlease understand that it is our editorial discretion to choose and transfer selected articles. We can’t publish all contributions on the main website; otherwise we wouldn’t have needed to launch “MyVoice”! Please read here why we decided to launch this community driven chapter.\n\nIf an article is not published on the main website, it simply means that it didn’t meet our requirements on that particular day. However, those requirements won’t necessarily be about the “editorial quality” of the article; it could be as technical as publishing schedule. Say, we had already published x number of articles on a day so your article couldn’t be accommodated.\n\nPlease understand that we are not trying to pass any editorial comment or leave any value judgment on your article by not transferring them to the main website. It could well be the case that an article published on “MyVoice” has better “editorial quality” than the one published on the main website.\n\nQ4. Why was my article not shared in the social media through main OpIndia social profiles?\n\nAnswer is same as the one offered for Q3 – please allow us that much of editorial discretion.\n\nQ5: Why was my article not picked for being Featured on top of homepage?\n\nAnswer is same as the one offered for Q3 – please allow us that much of editorial discretion.\n\nQ6. Can you delete or make changes to an article of mine that was already published?\n\nWe don’t allow changes to already published articles under normal circumstances. Please review and double check your articles before submitting them for review. If there is a genuine case for any modification, you can get in touch with us through email explaining the need for modification and we will consider it. Same goes for deletion of articles; you must explain and justify it with details. The final decision on deletion will be taken by our editorial team.\n\nQ7. Can you delete or make changes to an article of someone else that was published on your website? I find it offensive.\n\nSorry, we can’t entertain any requests of modifications if the article is not by you. We apologize if your sentiments were hurt, but we can’t do anything beyond that.\n\nBut you can do something more than that. You are encouraged to write a counter to the article (but it should meet our editorial guidelines). You should especially counter if you find an article making wrong claims or conclusions by writing a better argued article. If there is a compelling case, we can update the original article by appending a link to your counter article.\n\nQ8. Can you delete a comment left by some reader on an article of mine?\n\nThe comments on articles are not hosted by us on our servers. At the same time, we don’t pre-moderate comments but we allow community moderation. If you find a comment that is inappropriate due to some reason, you can flag it. Right now we can’t attend to complaint about individual comments.\n\nQ9. I think an article published on your website has been plagiarized from somewhere else.\n\nWe put some basic trust in our contributors and at the same time we also do some basic check before publishing the article. However, on occasions we might fail. If you find any plagiarism or any other problem with some article, please get in touch with us with all the relevant details and we will act on it.\n\nQ10. You keep telling us to get in touch with you, but how do we do that?\n\nPlease write an email to [email protected]\n\nQ11. My Twitter/Facebook/other social profile link is not working in the Author Box. When the social icon is clicked, it opens a new ‘My Voice’ page.\n\nPlease enter full URLs in your user profile so that your social profile links work e.g. instead of writing @xyz in the Twitter field, please write https://twitter.com/xyz (you MUST add the https:// part too).\n\nQ12. How can I change my profile picture shown in the Author Box?\n\nBy default, we use the display picture associated with your Gravatar.com account as your profile picture in the author box. If you don’t have any associated picture, you can either register with Gravatar.com using the same email address that you used to register with OpIndia.com or make changes to your user profile and upload your picture there. We recommend the option of creating a Gravatar account.",

		"title": "Birmingham civil rights history: The backstory behind the famous photo of Walter Gadsden, officer Dick Middleton, and his police dog.",
		"text": "Sixty years ago this month, in May 1963, police in Birmingham, Alabama, used clubs, fire hoses, and dogs to attack crowds of Black people demonstrating against racial segregation. The images of canines mauling protesters, ripping their clothes and biting their bodies, are some of the most disturbing visuals of the entire civil rights movement.\n\nA photograph of officer Dick Middleton setting a dog upon 15-year-old Walter Gadsden appeared on the front page of the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post on May 4. Newspapers in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America followed suit, prominently featuring pictures of Birmingham’s K-9s attacking protesters. Concerned about damage to the country’s reputation, the United States Information Agency conducted a study of global coverage of the events in Birmingham, concluding that “pictures of police brutality, particularly the use of police dogs, has militated strongly against the U.S. image.” The outcry was compounded by the fact that many of the protesters were school-age, as Martin Luther King Jr.’s lieutenant James Bevel had organized thousands of students to march in the “Children’s Crusade” against Jim Crow.\n\nThe attacks by Birmingham’s police dogs prompted three main responses from Americans. Conservative critics of the civil rights movement defended the dogs as a necessary law enforcement tool against criminals. Many white liberal observers in the North, by contrast, decried them as cruel weapons of a renegade police force, while insisting that the Birmingham police were a department of “bad apples” amid an otherwise honorable profession.\n\nBut it was civil rights organizers themselves whose response was most consequential. The dog attacks in Birmingham offered activists in the South and North a political language for analyzing police abuses within the larger context of Black people’s pursuit of freedom and equality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Philadelphia, NAACP picketers demanded “rights not bites,” while protesters in New York denounced “dog government in Alabama.” Some argued that Alabama authorities were not the only ones bearing responsibility for the attacks and highlighted the presence of the dogs to sharpen their critiques. As James Baldwin told a rally of predominantly white marchers in Los Angeles, “Those crimes in Birmingham, those dogs and fire hoses, are being committed in your name.” A headline in Baltimore’s Afro-American newspaper captured the mood: “B’ham’s Police Dogs Shock World.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, just as horrific videos of police killing Eric Garner, George Floyd, and Tyre Nichols would galvanize protests across the country and globe decades later, the outrage in the wake of the news of Birmingham’s K-9 unit brutalizing protesters as young as 4 injected a local movement into the national, and even global, consciousness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, as Birmingham’s police dogs have endured as powerful symbols of backlash against the civil rights movement, their origins have largely escaped scrutiny.\n\nIn 1963 liberal critics condemned the Alabama city’s K-9 unit as a relic of the Old South. The harder truth to accept, however, was that it was actually a product of a new America.\n\nFor many, attacks by police dogs on Black citizens conjured disturbing images from the era of slavery, when bounty hunters pursued escaped enslaved people with bloodhounds. But the police dog was an innovation of modern policing, not a throwback to past centuries. Indeed, the Birmingham Police Department’s dog squad was barely 4 years old when officers attacked protesters in Kelly Ingram Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1959 Birmingham’s notorious police commissioner and unapologetic segregationist Bull Connor assigned Sgt. M.W. McBride to move to Baltimore for three months to complete a course on dog handling offered there by the city’s police force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough it dated back only to 1956, Baltimore’s dog handling team had quickly established itself as the country’s first successful K-9 unit. A handful of other U.S. police forces had experimented with dogs before, but none had sustained a squad for more than a few years.\n\nAt the time, Baltimore leaders championed their city as a moderate, even progressive metropolis. Less than 30 miles south of the Mason-Dixon Line, Baltimore had turned its back on Reconstruction by the new century, even pioneering, in 1911, America’s first city ordinance requiring racially segregated housing. But by the decade following World War II, the city aimed to position itself as a willing adapter of integration. Scarcely two weeks after the Supreme Court delivered the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in May 1954, Baltimore’s school board voted to implement the decision. The city’s status as a major East Coast port and one of the country’s leading steel producers further reinforced its image among many white Americans as a leader of a forward-looking South, a regional trailblazer ready to make good on past injustices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Baltimoreans were far from satisfied with the pace of change. In January 1955—nearly a full year before the Montgomery bus boycott and five years before the Woolworth’s sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina—Black students from Morgan State College worked with the Congress of Racial Equality to stage a sit-in campaign at Read’s Drug Store branches in Baltimore that triggered the desegregation of the local chain’s restaurants.\n\nAuthorities in Baltimore worried about their city. As the Great Migration brought thousands of Black new arrivals from Virginia and the Carolinas to the industrial powerhouse, the city’s demographics changed rapidly, and by the decade’s end, about 33 percent of residents were Black, up from just 23 percent in 1950. White Baltimoreans began to flee the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“That the Negroes of Baltimore and of other urban centers commit more than their share of crime is certainly not news,” a Baltimore Sun editorial opened in January 1956, signaling just how widespread racist attitudes about this demographic shift were. The newspaper was quick to identify Black newcomers to the city as a problem. “It is not easy—indeed it is often impossible—for a country-bred colored boy to adjust himself to crowded city life. It is hard for him to get a job, and, even if he gets one, his slick friends often take his earnings from him. The temptation to get money by criminal means is thus always before him and too often he succumbs.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was at this moment of white flight, heightened racist fears about urban crime, and growing demands for equality that Baltimore’s police department launched its K-9 unit. Notably, other cities just below the Mason-Dixon Line, as well as self-styled New South metropolises that prided themselves on racial moderation, were quick to follow, with St. Louis, Atlanta, Houston, and Kansas City all creating their own police dog teams by 1959.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaltimore police promoted their dogs to other departments with an almost evangelical zeal, not unlike today’s law enforcement boosters who champion tasers and body cameras as humane, cutting-edge innovations. In addition to welcoming McBride from Birmingham, Baltimore’s K-9 unit opened its doors at various points to visiting police from D.C., New Jersey, and Rochester, New York, who all wanted to create their own K-9 divisions, and even international guests from Thailand, Turkey, Bolivia, Spain, and South Vietnam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReporters showered praise on Baltimore’s police dogs, often after they were invited by officials to admire the canines firsthand. “German Shepherds in Baltimore Prove Effective in Apprehending Bad Men” read one glowing New York Times headline from 1959. “The modern police dog is a highly trained animal that walks the streets with his handler with dignity and efficiency,” Sgt. William Kerbe boasted to the Times in a second feature on the unit that appeared in the paper just three years later, adding, “He is probably one of the most potent weapons given an officer.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Biemiller, a lieutenant in the unit, put it more bluntly: “One dog and an officer can handle four or five punks.” But if the canines were powerful, they were also safe, an impressed reporter for the Christian Science Monitor informed readers, uncritically repeating a dubious claim by Biemiller: “Police dogs are trained to seize and hold the right arm of their quarry. Unless the person struggles severely, no serious damage is caused.” The Associated Press, for its part, was happy to report that Baltimore police had discovered that “two patrolmen accompanied by dogs could keep order in a throng of rock ’n roll devotees after a show or a dance where formerly eight burly officers were required.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest of all, the dogs were reported to be expert crime fighters. The Baltimore Police Department’s annual report in 1956 heralded the new division, with a handler next to a large hound standing on its hind legs, its front paws perched on a chalkboard, seemingly giving its approval to a hand-drawn message: “Crime Reduced 26.9%.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaltimore police presented themselves as national authorities on K-9 units. In 1960 one officer, Irvin Marders, even published an instructional guide for law enforcement, How to Use Dogs Effectively in Modern Police Work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBirmingham police were no less proud of their K-9 unit, which McBride established shortly after returning to Alabama from Baltimore. The sergeant called his dogs Rebel and Blackie, names that suggested the department’s Confederate nostalgia and unrepentant racism. Connor and his department booked McBride and his dogs on Birmingham’s dinner-talk circuit, with appearances before the local Chamber of Commerce, Lions Club, and Kiwanis Club, and they trotted out the dogs for new station openings billed as community get-togethers. From the start, police dogs were prized not only for aiding officers in the field but also for their effectiveness in putting an adorable face on the less-than-attractive work of policing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it was because Birmingham’s white residents so embraced the K-9 units that city police were caught off guard by the national and international opprobrium they faced when the dogs attacked protesters in May 1963. Weeks earlier, Connor had even bragged to a state legislator, “Dogs have been of invaluable assistance to us here in keeping down violence in connection with the racial demonstrations.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the May 1963 attacks on Black protesters solidified Birmingham’s reputation for having America’s most brutal police, few if any media outlets reported the fact that the supposedly “good” Southern city of Baltimore had equipped the Alabama officers with one of its most ruthless enforcement tools. Indeed, by 1963, police forces across the country had replicated the Baltimore K-9 unit, with teams popping up everywhere from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, Honolulu, and Topeka, Kansas.\n\nThe real history of police dogs, it would seem, had been lost in the myth that the worst forms of police repression reveal a long history of Southern exceptionalism grounded in human bondage. More than many might like to admit, K-9 units instead betray law enforcement’s roots in racism throughout America after slavery was abolished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, in the 21st century, police continue to find sophisticated, questionable, and modern ways to use dogs to their advantage. While canines are rarely deployed for crowd control, they still do terrible harm, as evidenced by the death of Joseph Pettaway, a Black man killed by a police dog in Montgomery, Alabama, in 2018, whose family has filed a federal suit against the department, scheduled for trial this year. Today Birmingham, Baltimore, and countless other police departments operate K-9 units, and they continue to hurt people. As one study has found, about 3,700 people bitten by police dogs reported to emergency rooms in the U.S. every year between 2005 and 2013.\n\nAnd police departments are still eager to weaponize canines in the realm of public relations. Police dogs were all over the news in the wake of Tyre Nichols’ death at the hands of five Memphis police officers in January, as seen in puff pieces about law enforcement canines getting their mug shots taken or serving communities as comfort dogs. Perhaps the timing of all this was pure coincidence—or maybe many police and their supporters in the media hoped to promote feel-good stories about law enforcement, just as the profession was facing another wave of national outrage.",

		"title": "The Story Behind the Famous Little Rock Nine ‘Scream Image’",
		"text": "You’ve probably seen the photo: a young African American girl walks to school, her eyes shielded by sunglasses. She is surrounded by a hateful crowd of angry white people, including a girl caught mid-jeer, her teeth bared and her face hardened with anger. It’s one of the most famous images of the civil rights era, but it turns out that the story of the young women in the photo is even more complicated than the racial drama their faces portray.\n\nHazel Bryan was just 15 when the photo was taken, but her actions on September 4, 1957—and the hatred on her face—turned her into an infamous symbol of the bigotry of Jim Crow and the intolerance faced by the students who tried to go to school that day.\n\nIntegration of Central High School\n\nIt was the first day of school in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Elizabeth Eckford, also 15 and the girl Bryan was screaming at, was headed to class at Little Rock Central High School. That fact alone was anything but normal: Eckford and eight other Black students were recruits sent to the all-white school to test Arkansas’ supposed intention to integrate its schools.\n\nThree years earlier, the Supreme Court ruled the segregation of public schools unconstitutional. But in a South ruled by the brutality of Jim Crow, many whites clung to segregation. Like other Southern states, Arkansas dragged its feet, and when the Supreme Court tried to force integration with a second landmark decision, the Little Rock school board decided it would integrate its schools over a period of many years.\n\nTechnically, Little Rock Central High School was to be the first to integrate. Eckford and her fellow Black students were entitled to attend Central High under the law, but city officials gerrymandered the district in a way that would have forced the majority of Black students to attend a different school than whites. The NAACP decided to defy those rules and desegregate Central High on its own. The group recruited students, then registered them at the school.\n\nBottom row (L-R): Thelma Mothershed, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray; Top row (L-R): Jefferson Thomas, Melba Pattillo, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls, Daisy Bates (NAACP President), Ernest Green, 1957. (Credit: Everett Collection Historical/Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nBut on the first day of school, a mob of furious white people assembled to make sure they couldn’t get in. The Black students had trained for this moment. But nothing could prepare Eckford for the screaming, taunting crowd that surrounded the school. They called out for her to be lynched and yelled slogans like “Two, four, six eight, we don’t want to integrate!” In the midst of the horde, reporters and photojournalists recorded the chaos.\n\nWomen in the crowd “shrieked in spasms, as tears flowed down their cheeks,” wrote one reporter. Screams of obscenities and slurs echoed through Eckford’s ears. A group of girls—including Bryan— “started to shriek and wail” as Eckford passed and headed toward the school. As she clutched a folder, trying to move forward, Bryan screamed at her and told her to “go back to Africa.”\n\nEckford and the rest of the Nine never made it into school that day. Acting on the orders of Governor Orval Faubus, Arkansas National Guardsmen stopped her at the door and she was chased away from the school by the mob. Later that month, after President Dwight Eisenhower intervened, Eckford and the other eight students went back to school escorted by members of the 101st Airborne and were finally allowed in.\n\nThe crowd gathered outside Little Rock Central High School. The military men were ordered by Governor Orval Faubus to surround the school and prevent Black students from entering the grounds. (Credit: William P Straeter/AP/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe day after the incident, the photograph, taken by photojournalist Will Counts, ran on the front page of the Arkansas Democrat. It, and a similar wire photo taken by another photographer, quickly spread throughout the country. When Bryan received disapproving mail, her parents pulled her from the school.\n\nMeanwhile, Eckford endured constant harassment and hatred inside the school she had helped integrate. She was spat upon, punched, hit with eggs and vegetables and faced with a barrage of slurs and insults all year long. Though Eckford managed to finish the school year, the bigots of Little Rock could not abide another year with integrated schools. Rather than repeat integration the next year, they shut down schools altogether.\n\nBut though Little Rock’s schools reopened—and finally integrated—the year after, the story didn’t end there. When Eckford, who moved to St. Louis soon after, visited Little Rock at age 21, she received a call from Bryan, who apologized. Then they went their separate ways again.\n\nEckford stayed silent about her ordeals for years and suffered from depression and trauma throughout her adult life. Bryan spent years atoning on her own, learning about the civil rights movement and becoming more racially conscious. In 1997, Will Counts, the photographer whose iconic shot was by then considered a defining document of a moment in the struggle for Black equality in the United States, arranged for the two to meet in person. Forty years after Bryan screamed at Eckford, they reunited, reconciled and became friends.\n\nElizabeth Eckford in front of the main entrance of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, 2007. Eckford was the first of nine black schoolchildren to make history on September 4th, 1957 when she arrived, alone, for the first day of classes at the all-white high school. (Credit: Charles Ommanney/Getty Images)\n\nOr did they? After a brief, warm friendship that saw them attend events and seminars together and even pose for a poster entitled “Reconciliation” that featured a modern-day photo of the pair outside Little Rock Central, their paths split again when they realized they could not truly reconcile. “True reconciliation can occur only when we honestly acknowledge our painful, but shared past,” said Eckford.\n\nThough both Hazel Bryan—now Massery—and Elizabeth Eckford are still alive, it’s unclear if they will find that reconciliation during their lifetimes. Their journey from enemies to friends to tense acquaintances is a reminder of the lasting effects of America’s history, just as the photograph of two diametrically opposed girls shows just how far the nation has come.",

		"text": "Donna Isbell Walker\n\nThe Greenville (S.C.) News\n\nPIEDMONT, S.C. — On New Year’s Eve 1968, just before the dawn of 1969, two Marines were holed up in a bunker in the Marble Mountains of Vietnam.\n\nRockets and mortars were raining down all around Master Sgt. William H. Cox and his buddy, First Sgt. James \"Hollie\" Hollingsworth.\n\n“Charlie (the nickname for the North Vietnamese) was really putting on a fireworks show for us,” Cox said.\n\nAs the two Marines hunkered down, they made a pact: “If we survived this attack or survived Vietnam, we would contact each other every year on New Year’s,” Cox said.\n\n► Oct. 23:Trump presents Medal of Honor to Vietnam medic\n\n► Sept. 11:A timeline of U.S. entanglement in the Vietnam War\n\nFor nearly five decades, Cox, who lives in Piedmont, S.C., and Hollingsworth of Hephzibah, Ga., kept their promise.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Cox kept another promise: He stood guard at Hollingsworth’s casket and then delivered the eulogy at his funeral.\n\nStanding guard, without the cane that the 83-year-old normally uses, Cox was paying tribute, one Marine to another.\n\nBut in giving the eulogy, he fulfilled his final vow to his 80-year-old friend.\n\nWhen Cox learned that Hollingsworth was terminally ill, Cox traveled the 125 miles to visit. Hollingsworth asked Cox to give the eulogy at his funeral.\n\n“I said, ‘Boy, that’s a rough mission you’re assigning me to there,’ ” Cox said.\n\nThe military forges strong bonds among the men and women who serve, but for Marines, that connection is even stronger.\n\n“There’s a bond between Marines that’s different from any other branch of service. We’re like brothers,” Cox said.\n\nThe two men met on their way to Vietnam in 1968.\n\n► Sept. 11:Why the Vietnam War was the conflict no one wanted to talk about\n\n► Sept. 11:'I’ve questioned the decision for 40 years,' Army deserter on Vietnam\n\nAfter his service, Hollingsworth settled outside of Augusta, Ga. Cox spent 20 years in the Marine Corps and went on to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service.\n\nThey served in VMO-2, a Marine helicopter squadron, where Hollingsworth was a mechanic and a door gunner, and Cox was an ordnance chief and a door gunner.\n\n► Sept. 6:U.S. general on Vietnam War: ‘This was some enemy’\n\n► July 31:Retired Army medic James McCloughan awarded Medal of Honor\n\nThey flew many combat missions together, and at the end of each mission, they had a saying, which Cox repeated at the close of Hollingsworth’s eulogy:\n\n“Hollie, you keep ‘em flying, and I’ll keep ‘em firing.”\n\nFollow Donna Isbell Walker on Twitter: @DonnaIWalker",

		"text": "Bhavana Panday isn’t holding back when it comes to talking about her family’s close-knit bond with Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. In a fun and revealing chat with Siddharth Kannan on his YouTube channel, Bhavana served up some piping-hot anecdotes about SRK, proving once again why he’s a total legend—both on-screen and off.\n\nBhavana Panday praises Shah Rukh Khan\n\nFor Bhavana, Shah Rukh isn’t just Bollywood royalty but also a life coach extraordinaire for her daughters, Ananya and Rysa Panday. She credited him with shaping their personalities and teaching them the all-important lesson of healthy competition. “It’s not just about him being Shah Rukh Khan; it’s about the kind of father he is to Suhana, Aryan, and AbRam. He’s had the same approach with my kids, and it’s been nothing short of amazing,” she said, brimming with gratitude.\n\nApparently, SRK wasn’t just the King of Bollywood but also the king of sports day! Bhavana revealed that during his downtime, Shah Rukh would rally Ananya, Suhana, and Shanaya Kapoor for impromptu sports sessions. “Be it football or running, he was all in. While Chunky and I were too lazy for all that action, Shah Rukh would be out there teaching them the value of being competitive in a fun, supportive way. And he always took their side over Aryan and the boys!” she laughed.\n\nBhavna Panday’s views on Aryan Khan\n\nWhen the conversation turned to Aryan Khan, Bhavana had nothing but praise for him. She called him “one of the sweetest boys” she knows and lauded his impeccable manners. When asked if Aryan plays the overprotective big brother role, Bhavana cheekily added that Shah Rukh has raised all the girls to be so strong that they don’t need anyone else to stand up for them. Girl power alert!\n\nFor those who know Bhavana as one of the stars of Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives, this heartwarming insight into her bond with the Khans adds another layer to her glamorous life. From her 25-year marriage with Chunky Panday to her Netflix stardom, Bhavana proves she’s much more than just a Bollywood wife—she’s a storyteller who knows how to dish it out, spicy and sweet.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

		"title": "YouTuber Armaan Malik faces backlash after assaulting YouTuber Saurabh over disturbing comments about his daughter",
		"text": "The social media world was rocked recently when Armaan Malik, the YouTuber who's made waves for his unconventional marriage to two wives, found himself at the center of a dramatic assault controversy. Armaan, alongside his men, allegedly stormed the home of Haridwar-based YouTuber Saurabh, creating a major ruckus in the process. What followed was a physical altercation that left many wondering: was Armaan’s reaction justified?\n\nYouTuber Arman Malik controversy\n\nArmaan Malik has always been a hot topic on the internet, from sharing reels with his wives, Payal and Kritika, to becoming a viral sensation. But this latest incident took a dark turn when Armaan confronted Saurabh at his home in Khannanagar, Jwalapur. The reason? According to Armaan, it was a matter of family honour. He accused Saurabh of crossing the line by making indecent comments about his 1.5-year-old daughter in a YouTube video. The thumbnail of the video allegedly read, \"Armaan ne kiya apne beti ka r*pe,\"(Armaan r*ped his daughter) which Armaan claims was the tipping point that led to the heated encounter.\n\nThings got messy fast. Saurabh, who had shared roast videos of Armaan and his family, told the police that Armaan not only entered his home but physically assaulted him and acted disrespectfully toward his mother. While Armaan admitted to the confrontation, he argued that his reaction was triggered by the vile remarks about his daughter. The police, however, scolded him for barging into someone’s home and causing chaos. After both parties were interrogated, neither lodged a formal complaint, though the tension between them remained palpable.\n\nYouTuber Armaan Malik’s statement\n\nIn an emotional statement, Armaan explained that he had already filed a complaint against Saurabh and had attempted to resolve the matter amicably. He expressed regret over the situation, noting that it was not the way he wanted things to escalate. \"If my audience thinks Saurabh's actions weren’t wrong, I’ll apologize publicly,\" he said, revealing that after the incident, Saurabh was forced to delete his videos and even apologize to Armaan's family.\n\nBut the controversy doesn't end there. The whole ordeal has sparked widespread debate about online behaviour, the ethics of social media fame, and where the line should be drawn when it comes to family respect.\n\nTo stay updated on the stories that are going viral follow Indiatimes Trending",

		"text": "\"You are telling him not to sing or make songs about alcohol but then you're selling liquor everywhere,\" fired back Badshah, delivering a scathing response in support of Diljit Dosanjh, whom he regards as an elder brother, following the recent controversy over lyrics of his song referencing alcohol.\n\nOn Friday, rapper Badshah came out in strong support of Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosanjh during an appearance at Sahitya Aaj Tak.\n\nBadshah echoed Diljit's recent comments, agreeing with the singer's stance that he would stop making alcohol-themed songs the day liquor shops are shut down across the country.\n\nThe rapper also called attention to what he saw as a glaring double standard—while musicians are being criticised for referencing alcohol in their songs, liquor is sold freely across the nation.\n\n\"He is totally right. You are telling him not to sing or make songs about alcohol, but then you're selling liquor everywhere. Why shouldn't they be made? An artist represents society, and that's what keeps them relevant. They speak about things that the whole world wants to say,\" Badshah said.\n\nDiljit, currently on his Dil-Luminati Tour, had earlier clarified that he doesn't consume alcohol himself and would happily take a pledge to stop singing such songs, provided liquor shops are closed nationwide.\n\n\"If you don't want him to sing about something, then that thing shouldn't be in society in the first place,\" Badshah added.\n\nExpressing deep admiration for Diljit, he shared, \"He means a lot to me because he is like an elder brother to me. Whenever I've faced problems, he's always been there to guide me. There's so much to learn from him—he's an inspiration. He's a very nice person. One should always treat such a person with care in life.\"\n\nWhat is the Diljit Dosanjh alcohol controversy?\n\nCredit: IG/ Diljit Dosanjh\n\nThe Telangana government had issued a warning to the organisers of Diljit Dosanjh's concert in Hyderabad, stating that any songs promoting violence, drugs, or alcohol would not be allowed.\n\nIn response, Diljit showcased his creativity by adjusting his lyrics on the spot to comply with the restrictions.\n\nAfter his performance in Hyderabad, Diljit moved on to Ahmedabad, where, despite not receiving any such directive from the Gujarat government, he once again chose to avoid alcohol-themed songs.\n\nAddressing the crowd, Diljit explained, \"Even today, I won't sing any song about alcohol. That's because Gujarat is a dry state.\"\n\nHe went on to propose a bold challenge, saying, \"Let's start a movement—if all states ban liquor consumption completely, I will never sing a song about alcohol again in my entire life. Is this possible? During COVID, everything was closed except liquor shops. You can't fool the youth. If not a complete ban, then at least declare a dry day in your state on the day of my performance, and I will refrain from singing any alcohol-related song.\"\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

		"title": "Pornography and Gen Z: The hidden impact on mental health, relationships, and self-image",
		"text": "Written by: Dr Neha Mehta\n\nThis generation - or Gen Z as they are now known all across - is facing a major issue; the widespread access to pornography. Over the past decade, the internet has made explicit content incredibly easy to access, and many youngsters are viewing it without fully understanding the long-term effects that it may have on them.\n\nNearly 93 per cent of boys and 62 per cent of girls have been exposed to pornography before they turn 18. This startling data from the American Psychological Association (APA) highlights how common it has become for Gen Z to encounter explicit content online.\n\nEven as doctors and psychologists warn about the harmful effect that early exposure to such content leading can have on brain development, mental health, and sexual behavior, parents, educators, and health experts remain a worried lot.\n\nAnd this frequent exposure to explicit content can lead youngsters to seek out more extreme material to feel the same excitement, leading to addictive behaviour. As a result of which many young people find themselves in a vicious loop of watching pornography, despite knowing how terribly it’s going to affect their lives and hamper their daily activities, and school performance, and don’t even get started on the “high-expectations” with relationships, and all of his leads to even more mental health problems.\n\nThe problems with Gen Z exposure to pornography at such young age\n\nGen Z is navigating a crucial stage of development, both emotionally and mentally. Their brains are still growing, and they are trying to figure out their identities, relationships, and the world around them. Exposure to pornography can lead to several serious problems that affect their growth and well-being.\n\nUnrealistic expectations about relationships and intimacy: Young people may come to believe that the exaggerated scenes they encounter in pornography reflect their real-life relationships and intimacy. But hey, wait this is not at all true, what they see and what they experience can never be the same, but these films can definitely confuse and harm their future relationships.\n\nBody image issues and self-esteem challenges: Seeing idealized bodies in porn films can make young people feel insecure about their appearance, leading to low self-esteem.\n\nThe rising risk of addiction to pornography: Repeated exposure to pornography can trigger the brain’s reward system, and this is exactly how drugs work. Over the time, this can lead to dependency, with young people seeking more extreme content to experience the same level of excitement.\n\nMental health concerns linked to pornography consumption: Research shows that young people who consume pornography regularly are more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nGen Z, exposed to pornography, often face difficulties in impulse control and emotional regulation, which can affect their relationships. Additionally, the unrealistic portrayals of intimacy in pornography can create confusion about confusion about real-life relationships, leading to skewed ideas about sexual behavior and expectations.\n\nSteps to address the issue of porn addiction - what should parents do?\n\nWhile this issue may seem overwhelming, there are several steps that can reduce the negative effects of pornography:\n\nOpen conversations with children: Parents and guardians should talk openly with their kids about the potentials dangers they might encounter online. It’s important to explain that pornography doesn’t show healthy or realistic relationships.\n\nBetter sex education: And instead of just basic reproduction chapters, schools need to offer comprehensive sex education “without hesitation” that can help the children to understand the difference between pornography and real-life relationships.\n\nMental health support: For children who have been exposed to excessive explicit content, then therapy and counseling can help them process their feelings and avoid negative consequences.\n\nCredit: Self\n\nAbout the author: Expert Dr Neha Mehta, a renowned psychologist and sex therapist, has been a leading voice in mental health and sexual counseling for over a decade. She has counselled young teenagers and encouraged them to talk openly about their feelings and experiences related to pornography over the years. Through her sessions, she urges parents and teachers to talk openly about how pornography affects the mental health and relationships of young folks, helping them understand intimacy better.

		"text": "Shoppers alert! Black Friday is the day following Thanksgiving, which is Thursday, November 28 this year, so the shopping holiday falls on Friday, November 29.\n\nWhat is the history of Black Friday?\n\nCredit: Pexels\n\nAccording to USA Today, Black Friday has become one of the year's largest shopping and sales events. The day following Thanksgiving is thought to have received the epithet \"Black Friday\" in the 1950s when Philadelphia police invented the name to characterize the havoc they witnessed as suburban consumers flooded the city.\n\nBy 1961, the name had caught on in Philadelphia, but it didn't spread nationwide until the late 1980s, when retailers took advantage of the opportunity to re-frame the day as something more positive, inventing the analogy of stores going from being \"in the red\" (in financial deficit) to being \"in the black\" (profitable) the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nWhen does the Black Friday Sale start on Amazon?\n\nAccording to USA Today, Amazon's Black Friday Week will begin on Thursday, November 21, and continue through Friday, November 29. Deals include up to 55% off popular Amazon goods such as Amazon Fire Smart TVs, Kindles, Ring doorbells, and Beats headphones. Levi's family denim is also up to 50% off, as is OROLAY clothing.\n\nWhere can Indian shoppers expect to avail discounts?\n\nCredit: Pexels\n\nSimilar to last year, major e-commerce sites such as Tata Cliq, Flipkart, and Amazon are likely to offer tempting bargains on a wide range of products, including electronics, apparel, and home essentials.\n\nWhile many Indian retailers participate in Black Friday, shoppers can also find offers on international websites. Customers will be liable for shipping fees and any relevant import charges.\n\n\n\nAlso read: New To The U.S. Sale Scene?

		"text": "When Anushka Sharma showed up to cheer for Virat Kohli during the India vs Australia Test match in Perth, fans knew it was going to be an iconic moment. The Bollywood diva was all smiles, clapping, celebrating, and radiating nothing but positive energy from the stands. Talk about wife goals, right?\n\nAnushka Sharma supports Virat Kohli during test match\n\nSporting a simple yet stunning look—think white T-shirt, denim jeans, and that effortlessly chic vibe—Anushka was living her best “supportive partner” moment. And let’s just say, her vibe was SO contagious that fans couldn’t stop talking about it on social media. One fan even went so far as to call her \"Kohli's ladyluck\" (we see you, lucky charm!).\n\nThe actress was seen not only clapping for her hubby but also celebrating with Sanjana Ganesan when Harshit Rana took Virat's advice to get Mitchell Starc out. In case you missed it, Anushka was also spotted holding a plate in one hand, casually rocking the “mom-on-the-go” look while rooting for her cricket king. And of course, fans went wild—one even exclaimed, \"Bhabhi ji in the house!\"\n\nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s cute moment\n\nThe cutest moment, though? Before the match kicked off, Anushka and Virat were spotted having a chill family moment, sipping coffee together while their daughter, Vamika, relaxed in her stroller. Ahh, family goals, people!\n\nVirat and Anushka’s adorable duo has been all about that family time, especially since welcoming their second child, a son named Akaay, in February 2024. But let's be real—whether it's parenthood or cricket, Anushka is always the rock behind her man. They’ve kept their kids' faces private, which only adds to their mystery.\n\nAnushka Sharma's work front\n\nAs for Anushka’s career, the actress has been a little MIA from films, last appearing in Zero (2018). But fear not! She completed the much-anticipated Chakda Xpress, a biopic of cricketer Jhulan Goswami, which is expected to hit Netflix soon.\n\nIn the meantime, Anushka’s in full-on mom-and-supportive-wife mode. And honestly, with the way she’s cheering Virat on, we wouldn’t be surprised if Kohli hits a century—because, hello, this queen’s got magic powers.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

		"text": "Shivarajkumar, one of Sandalwood’s biggest stars, is currently in the limelight because of Bhairathi Ranagal. The eagerly-awaited film hit the screens on November 15 and opened to a good response at the box office. It then packed a punch over the first weekend and remained fairly stable on the weekdays. Bhairathi Ranagal raked in a respectable amount on its second Friday (November 22) and continued its run.\n\nBhairathi Ranagal day 8 box office collection\n\nBhairathi Ranagal, starring Shivanna, is doing reasonably well at the domestic box office. According to Sacnilk, a trade website, the crime drama netted Rs 49 lakh in India yesterday. The figure is nearly 22% lower than the Rs 63 lakh it earned on Wednesday (November 21).\n\nHere is the day-wise breakdown:\n\nDay 1: Rs 2.3 crore\n\nDay 2: Rs 2.7 crore\n\nDay 3: Rs 3.4 crore\n\nDay 4: Rs 1.65 crore\n\nDay 5: Rs 94 lakh\n\nDay 6: Rs 80 lakh\n\nDay 7: Rs 63 lakh\n\nDay 8: Rs 49 lakh\n\nThe total collection stands at Rs 13 crore.\n\nBhairathi Ranagal is expected to witness a slight drop in collection today (November 23) as it’s a working day. However, it is likely to witness some growth over its second weekend as the word-of-mouth is positive. Additionally, it does not face much competition from Kanguva— especially in Karnataka– as the Siva-directed film has failed to impress the audience.\n\nAbout Bhairathi Ranagal\n\nBhairathi Ranagal, featuring Shivanna in the titular role, is a sequel and a prequel to Mufti (2017). The recently released film features the veteran actor in the role of a crime boss. The narrative revolves around the protagonist's rise in the world of crime. The film also touches upon the events that take place after what was shown in Mufti. Bhairathi Ranagal's cast includes Rukmini Vasanth, Avinash, Chaya Singh, and Rahul Bose. Ravi Basrur is its music composer. He became the toast on Sandalwood with his work on the Prabhas-led Salaar and Yash-fronted KGF franchise. Moreover, he has also provided the background score for Rohit Shetty's Singham Again.\n\nThis is Shivarajkumar’s second Kannada film of the year after Karataka Damanaka , which hit the screens in March. Based on the Panchatantra, it featured Priya Anand as the leading lady and marked her first collaboration with him. Prabhudeva played a key role in his first Sandalwood film after 17 years. Shivanna recently revealed that he will be paired with a Bollywood actress in a ‘mature love story'. He, however, did not disclose her name. The mass hero was also offered a role in the H Vinoth-directed Thalapathy 69, Vijay’s last film. However, things didn't work out and the director withdrew the offer.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Suriya-led fantasy drama, however, failed to hold its own on its second Friday (November 22).

According to Sacnilk, a trade tracking website, the film netted Rs 61 lakh at the ticket window on Friday (November 22). This is the lowest it has collected on a given day since its release. The figure is also nearly 26% lower than the Rs 1.9 crore it raked in on Thursday (November 21).\n\nHere is the day-wise breakdown for Kanguva:\n\nDay 1: Rs 24 crore\n\nDay 2: Rs 9.5 crore\n\nDay 3: Rs 9.85 crore\n\nDay 4: Rs 10.25 crore\n\nDay 5: Rs 3.15 crore\n\nDay 6: Rs 3.25 crore\n\nDay 7: Rs 2.40 crore\n\nDay 8: Rs 1.9 crore\n\nDay 9: Rs 61 lakh\n\nThe total collection stands at nearly Rs 64 crore.\n\nThe film is expected to witness some growth today (November 23) as it's a weekend.

The biographical drama remains the top choice of the Tamil audience even in its fourth week.\n\nAbout Kanguva\n\nKanguva, Suriya’s first film with Siva, is a fantasy drama that centres on the events that transpire when a shadow cop meets a child with a ‘past’ and develops a bond with him. The film explores themes such as ‘resurrection’ and ‘forgiveness’. The biggie stars Bobby Deol as Udhiran, the antagonist, and marks his Kollywood debut. Disha Patani, Yogi Babu, and Redin Kingsley too are part of the cast. Karthi has a cameo in the film and will feature prominently in Kanguva 2.\n\nWith Kanguva in theatres, Suriya is set to turn his attention to his film with Karthik Subbaraj.

		"title": "Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein S2 ending explained: Will Vikrant and Shikha ever find happily ever after?",
		"text": "Season 2 of Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein is now available on OTT giant Netflix. But if you have watched the thriller series and are still confused about its end, here's an ending explained just for you.\n\nNote: If you have not seen the show on Netflix yet, you know what to do. (Skip, skip, skip!)\n\nHow did it begin this time?\n\nThe first episode of Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein season 2 began with the scenes where Vikrant is seen desperately trying to get himself away from his wife, Purva, as he never loved her. Vikrant this time basically planned Purva's kidnap with Sherpa and his people in order to get her out of his life and be back to the love of his life, Shikha, aka Dolly.\n\nAs the story progresses, Shikha is shown getting married to a police officer.\n\nDrastic turn of events?\n\nFurther in the episodes, Shikha is seen calling Vikrant for help. Why did she want his help? Well, it is Dharmesh and his body. With the unclear intention, Dharmesh was found injured lying inside Shikha's house. The story takes a drastic turn when Vikrant decides to kill Dharmesh and then eventually cut him into pieces to hide his death from the world.\n\nThe series shows how Vikrant and Shikha make a team to further hide the truth behind the death of Dharmesh, a family member and close ally to Akhiraj.\n\nWhat else is there in the show this time?\n\nThe biggest secret that was revealed in the latest episodes of the season was that Sherpa’s intention was not to take revenge against Akhiraj through Purva's kidnapping as the makers tried to make it look like, but it was Purva’s mother who was behind it all.\n\nPurva's mother in this season was shown hoping for a reunion with her daughter before she dies.\n\nThe show also revolves around Purva’s childhood. It raises many questions, like why did she not return to her father after her mother’s death? Where was Akhiraj during this time? Was he living abroad with Purva, or did his friend Sherpa step in to take care of her?\n\nComing back to Purva's kidnapping\n\nPurva gets saved from the kidnapping but gets ready to discover the truth about Akhiraj’s past and his role in her mother’s disappearance. She basically starts questioning everything she once believed.\n\nEnding explained?\n\nThe last episode of season 2 shows Purva meeting Shikha at a guest house and Vikrant at a Buddhist temple ruining the escape plan of the lovebirds.\n\nPurva’s intentions are left unclear as she may punish Shikha and Vikrant for their betrayal, or she may help them go away from the chaos created.\n\nThe last scene shows Vikrant shooting in the air. Now there are some cliffhangers, like who is shooting at? Is it Akhiraj’s goons? Will Vikrant and Shikha ever find their happily ever after, or will Purva continue to bother them? These questions can only be answered with season 3, which the makers are yet to announce.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

On February 27, 2002, as the train stopped at the Godhra station, one of its coaches was set on fire, which resulted in the deaths of over 55 passengers. Most of the victims were kar sevaks who were returning from the site in Ayodhaya where they supported the construction of a Hindu temple at the disputed Babri Masjid site. The incident triggered communal riots in Gujarat and later resulted in more deaths. The riots became a subject of international condemnation.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

		"title": "Naga Chaitanya’s birthday: How rich is the Thandel actor? Exploring the star’s net worth and sources of income",
		"text": "Naga Chaitanya is one of the most popular names in the Telugu film industry. The ‘Yuvasamrat’, veteran actor Nagarjuna’s son, began his career with Josh (2009) and went on to find a foothold in Tollywood with his sincere performances. He has also often been in the news because of his personal life. The star dated Samantha Ruth Prabhu for nearly seven years before marrying her in 2017. The two eventually parted ways in 2021. Earlier this year, Naga Chaitanya got engaged to Sobhita Dhulipala. The two are now gearing up to tie the knot. On Saturday (November 23), as Naga Chaitanya turns 38, here is a closer look at his net worth and sources of income.\n\nNaga Chaitanya net worth and assets\n\nNaga Chaitanya, who is a part of the prestigious Akkineni family, turns a year older today. According to News 18, the Majili actor’s net worth is around Rs 154 crore. A major chunk of this comes from his work in Telugu cinema. As per report published by India Today in 2022, Chay charges between Rs 5 crore and Rs 10 crore per film. The exact amount, however, depends on the performance of his past films.\n\nNaga Chaitanya also has other sources of income that are not directly related to his work in films. In 2022, the actor launched Shouyu– a cloud kitchen that specialises in Southeast-Asian cuisine– in Hyderabad. Earlier this year, he expanded this venture by launching an outlet at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.\n\nNaga Chaitanya also utilises his social media presence to engage in brand endorsements. He has previously endorsed brands such as Magnum India and Myntra. That said, he maintains a relatively low profile on social media compared to his peers.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, the star made headlines when he purchased property in Jubilee Hills. It was said to be valued at Rs 15 crore.\n\nNaga Chaitanya is also extremely passionate about automobiles. His car collection includes high-end models The Ferrari F430 is a prized possession and it costs nearly Rs 1.75 crore. He is also the proud owner of a G-Class G63, which costs nearly Rs 1 crore. Additionally, he has an equally impressive bike collection. He owns a MV Agusta F4, which costs nearly Rs 25 lakh. The BMW R9T, which costs nearly Rs 19 lakh, is an equally prized possession.\n\nWork matters\n\nOn the work front, Naga Chaitanya was last seen in Custody, which bombed at the box office. The Telugu-Tamil bilingual was directed by Venkat Prabhu and received negative reviews. Its cast included Arvind Swami, Krithi Shetty, Priyamani and Jayasudha. Chay will next be seen in Thandel, which marks his second collaboration with Sai Pallavi after Love Story. Thandel has been shot on a budget of Rs 80 crore.\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of OTT, and celebrities from Bollywood and Hollywood, keep reading Indiatimes Entertainment.",

		"text": "AR Rahman’s net worth, income and more: AR Rahman, the legendary musician, recently announced his separation from his wife, Saira Banu, after nearly 30 years of marriage. While this news has surprised many, it has also brought attention to his incredible wealth and lifestyle. From his successful career to his luxurious houses and cars, let’s explore AR Rahman’s net worth and achievements.\n\nAR Rahman biography Birth 6 January 1967 Birth Place Madras (Now Chennai), Tamil Nadu Original Name AS Dileep Kumar Full Name Allah Rakha Rahman (A.R.

Ameen (son) Net Worth Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 2,000 crore Awards Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, 2 Oscars, National Awards\n\nAR Rahman’s Net Worth\n\nAR Rahman is not only one of India’s most famous musicians but also one of the richest. According to DNA and other sources, his net worth is estimated to be between Rs 1,728 crore and Rs 2,000 crore, making him the richest male singer in India.\n\nHow much is AR Rahman's fee?\n\nRahman’s talent and hard work have earned him huge fees. He reportedly charges up to Rs 3 crore per song and Rs 10 crore per film, making him the highest-paid music composer in the country, reported in TOI.\n\nAR Rahman’s Lavish Homes\n\nAR Rahman owns several luxurious properties that reflect his success.\n\nChennai Home\n\nRahman’s grand bungalow in Chennai is one of his prized properties. The house has beautifully designed interiors, spacious bedrooms, a large living area with leather sofas, a big dining space, and even a music studio. This home is a perfect mix of style and comfort.\n\nApartment in Los Angeles\n\nWhen visiting the United States, Rahman stays at his luxurious Los Angeles apartment, which also serves as a music studio. This setup allows him to live and work comfortably without needing to travel far.\n\nMusic Studios Around the World\n\nRahman’s creativity is backed by his state-of-the-art studios, named KM Musiq Studios, located in Mumbai, London, and Los Angeles. These studios are where many of his iconic compositions come to life.\n\nAR Rahman’s Luxury Cars\n\nRahman’s love for luxury can also be seen in his collection of high-end cars. His impressive garage includes:\n\n- A Volvo SUV worth Rs 93.87 lakh\n\n- A Jaguar priced at Rs 1.08 crore\n\n- A Mercedes valued at Rs 2.86 crore\n\nThese cars are a reflection of his sophisticated taste and success.\n\nAR Rahman’s Amazing Career\n\nAR Rahman started his musical journey at a very young age. At just four years old, he helped his father, RK Shekhar, who was a film music composer. Sadly, his father passed away when Rahman was nine, and he had to focus on music to support his family.\n\nThe Start of His Success\n\nRahman’s big break came in 1992 when filmmaker Mani Ratnam asked him to compose the music for the Tamil movie Roja. The success of this soundtrack launched his career and set him on the path to international fame.\n\nGlobal Achievements\n\nOver the years, Rahman has created some of the most memorable songs in Indian cinema, including Jai Ho from Slumdog Millionaire, which won him an Oscar. He has also worked on Hollywood films like 127 Hours and Million Dollar Arm, proving his talent on a global stage.\n\nAR Rahman’s Early Life and Faith\n\nAR Rahman was born as Dileep Kumar in Chennai on January 6, 1967. After his father’s death, his family struggled financially. Despite these challenges, Rahman focused on music and trained in piano and synthesizers. He later received a scholarship to study at Trinity College of Music in London.\n\nIn 1989, Rahman and his family converted to Islam, and he adopted the name Allah Rakha Rahman. This decision brought a new perspective to his life and career.\n\nAR Rahman’s Personal Life\n\nRahman’s personal life has always been of interest to his fans. Recently, he announced his separation from his wife, Saira Banu, which caught many people by surprise. Despite this, Rahman remains dedicated to his music and continues to inspire millions with his work.\n\nAR Rahman children\n\nHe has two daughters and one son - Khateeja Rahman (daughter), Rahima Rahman (daughter), and A.R. Ameen (son)\n\nAR Rahman’s Religion\n\nAfter losing his father at a young age, AR Rahman and his family faced challenging times. Originally practising Hindus, they embraced Islam when Rahman was in his 20s.\n\nThe family was drawn to Sufism, which influenced their decision to convert. Before the release of Rahman’s first major project, Roja, his mother, Kareema Begum, insisted on having his new name appear in the film’s credits. She was so firm about this change that she preferred his name to be left out entirely rather than use his old one.\n\nMany people ask Rahman if converting to Islam was the key to his success, but he avoids giving direct answers. Speaking about his faith, Rahman once said, “It’s not about converting to Islam; it’s about discovering what resonates with you. The spiritual teachings of Sufi masters were profoundly meaningful to me and my mother. Every faith has something unique to offer, and this was the path we chose. We are firm in our belief.”\n\nFrom his early struggles to becoming a global icon, AR Rahman’s story is truly inspiring. His incredible net worth, luxurious properties, high-end cars, and unmatched career show the power of hard work and talent. As one of India’s most respected musicians, Rahman’s legacy will always be remembered.",

		"title": "Joe Biden's birthday: How rich Is the 46th President of the US? Exploring his net worth, income, salary, houses and more",
		"text": "Joe Biden's net worth: Joe Biden, the 46th President of the United States, is celebrating his 82nd birthday on 20 November. As one of the most influential figures in modern politics, Biden’s life has been a mix of significant achievements, personal loss, and financial stability. Let’s take a closer look at his wealth, income, and long political career.\n\nJoe Biden's Net Worth\n\nJoe Biden’s net worth stands at an estimated $10 million as of June 2024 according to Forbes, a relatively modest figure compared to other prominent American politicians. A major portion of his wealth is invested in real estate, particularly two valuable properties in Delaware.\n\nWilmington Home: Biden’s main residence is located in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nCredit: X/ @SamJownes\n\nRehoboth Beach Property: His summer house, spanning 4,800 square feet, was purchased in 2017 for $2.7 million. During the pandemic, its value rose to $4.5 million, reflecting the surge in demand for homes in quieter, natural settings. However, with rising interest rates, housing prices have recently stabilised.\n\nJoe Biden's Income and Salary\n\nThe President of the United States earns an annual salary of $400,000, a figure set by Congress in 2001 and unchanged since then. While this is a significant amount, it falls below the U.S. income threshold for the top 1%, which is currently around $788,000. Compared to other world leaders, such as Singapore’s Prime Minister, who earns approximately $1.6 million, the U.S. president’s salary is relatively modest on a global scale.\n\nIn addition to the salary, the president benefits from numerous perks, including residence in the White House, use of Air Force One and Marine One, access to a fleet of armoured limousines, and round-the-clock protection from the Secret Service. These extras bring the total annual compensation package to around $569,000.\n\nAdditional Allowances and Benefits\n\nThe president’s compensation includes several allowances and non-salary perks, which enhance the $400,000 base salary and make the role more financially rewarding, even if it doesn’t match the earnings of other global leaders.\n\n- Expense Allowance: The president is given a non-taxable allowance of $50,000 for personal and official expenses.\n\n- Travel and Entertainment Funds: An additional $100,000 travel account and a $19,000 entertainment budget support the president's duties.\n\n- White House Redecoration: Upon taking office, the president is allocated $100,000 for redecorating the White House to their taste.\n\nWhen these allowances are combined, the total compensation package reaches approximately $569,000 per year, covering operational and ceremonial needs associated with the presidency.\n\nPerks After Leaving Office\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nEven after U.S. President Joe Biden's term ends, he will enjoy numerous privileges. These include an annual pension of around $230,000, healthcare benefits, and funding for office space and staff. Additionally, they receive allowances for official travel, enabling them to continue their public service and maintain their role as national figures.\n\nIn 2022, Biden secured a $250,000 line of credit to access extra funds. By the end of 2023, he had used over $100,000 of this credit, which comes with a variable interest rate of prime plus 1.99%. This means his borrowing costs change with interest rate adjustments.\n\nBiden has also earned additional income by renting out properties. For instance, in 2012, he rented a cottage on his Delaware estate to the Secret Service, earning $26,400 that year.\n\nBiden’s Real Estate Journey\n\nJoe Biden has a long history of smart real estate investments:\n\n- 1970s Mansion Purchase: During a financial recession, Biden bought a 10,000-square-foot mansion for $185,000, borrowing $160,000 for the purchase. He later sold it for $1.2 million in 1996.\n\n- New Homes in Delaware: Biden purchased land in the same area for $350,000 and built two homes on it.\n\nDespite his real estate success, Biden has faced personal tragedies. In December 1972, he lost his first wife and young daughter in a car accident shortly after purchasing a house in Chevy Chase, Washington, DC. This heartbreaking incident profoundly influenced his life and career.\n\nJoe Biden’s Political Career: A Lifelong Commitment to Public Service\n\nBorn on 20 November 1942, Joe Biden has spent most of his life in politics. He began his career at the age of 29, joining the Democratic Party. Over the years, he has been a central figure in shaping policies on domestic issues, foreign relations, and criminal justice.\n\nKey Milestones in Biden’s Career\n\n- Vice Presidency: From 2008 to 2016, Biden served as Vice President under Barack Obama, playing a significant role in major government decisions.\n\n- Presidency: In 2020, he became the 46th President of the United States. His leadership during challenges like the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis has earned widespread recognition.\n\n- Unique Legacy: Biden is one of only 15 individuals in US history to have served as both Vice President and President. He is also one of six to achieve the presidency after holding the vice presidency.\n\nRecognitions and Awards\n\nAs a tribute to his remarkable service, Biden received the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction from Barack Obama in January 2017. This is the highest civilian honour in the United States, reflecting his dedication to the nation.\n\nAs Joe Biden celebrates his 82nd birthday, his life story reflects hard work, resilience, and service to the country. From a steady income and a modest net worth to decades of political accomplishments, Biden continues to inspire people worldwide.\n\nWhether discussing Joe Biden’s net worth, income, or career, the 46th President of the United States remains a respected and influential figure in global politics.\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

		"title": "Stock market holidays: No trading on NSE & BSE today, November 20 – Here’s why",
		"text": "Stock market holidays today: India’s major stock exchanges, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), are closed today, 20 November 2024. This closure is due to the Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024, a key state election. Let’s explore why the stock market is closed and its effect on trading activities, along with what lies ahead.\n\nWhy Are NSE and BSE Closed Today?\n\nThe stock markets are observing a holiday today because of the Maharashtra election 2024. This election, which is being held in a single phase, will determine the representatives for the 288-member state legislative assembly. The counting of votes will take place on 23 November 2024.\n\nAs a result, trading on both the NSE and BSE has been halted across various segments.\n\nWhich Market Segments Are Affected?\n\nThe closure impacts some market segments entirely, while others are only partially affected:\n\n- Segments Fully Closed\n\n- Equity Segment\n\n- Derivatives Segment\n\n- Stock Lending and Borrowing (SLB) Segment\n\n- Segments Open for Evening Only\n\nCommodity Derivatives and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGR) will not operate in the morning session (9:00 am to 5:00 pm) but will be open for trading in the evening session (5:00 pm to 11:55 pm), reported in Money Control.\n\nThis scheduled closure is part of the public holiday calendar applicable to India’s stock exchanges.\n\nHoliday Calendar for NSE and BSE in 2024\n\nThe NSE and BSE follow an annual holiday schedule, which includes pre-determined non-trading days. Here’s what the calendar looks like for 2024:\n\n- Total Holidays Announced: 16\n\n- Holidays Already Observed: 14\n\n- Last Trading Holiday: 15 November, for Guru Nanak Jayanti\n\n- Next Trading Holiday: 25 December, for Christmas Day\n\nTrading on both the NSE and BSE will resume as normal on Thursday, 21 November 2024.\n\nHow to Check the Stock Market Holiday Schedule\n\nYou can easily find the holiday list for the NSE and BSE online:\n\n- Visit the official NSE website.\n\n- Hover over the \"Resources\" tab.\n\n- Click on “Holidays” under the “Exchange Communication” section.\n\nThis will give you the complete list of trading holidays for the year.\n\nMarket Activity Before the Holiday\n\nOn 19 November, the day before today’s closure, the stock markets experienced a day of ups and downs:\n\nThe BSE Sensex rose by over 1,000 points during the day but ended with a smaller gain of 239 points (0.31%), closing at 77,578.38. Similarly, the NSE Nifty50 saw a modest increase of 64.7 points (0.28%), closing at 23,518.50. While there were some gains, investor sentiment remained cautious. The Nifty50 is still in a correction phase, having fallen nearly 10% from its record high of 26,277 reached in September 2024.

Renowned for his catchy rap songs and energetic beats, Badshah has captured the hearts of millions. From his humble beginnings in a small town to becoming one of India’s biggest rap stars, Badshah’s journey has been anything but ordinary. As he celebrates his 39th birthday, let’s take a closer look at his career, net worth, lavish lifestyle, cars, houses, and family.\n\nBadshah’s Net Worth: How Much is the Rapper Worth?\n\nBollywood singer and rapper Badshah’s net worth is estimated to be around Rs 124 crore, according to Koimoi.com. This wealth comes from multiple income sources, including his music career, luxury business ventures, nightclubs, and real estate investments. Badshah’s earnings are also boosted by brand endorsements and partnerships, making him one of the richest musicians in India.\n\nBadshah’s Early Life and Rise to Fame\n\nBadshah was born in Delhi to a government officer father from Haryana and a teacher mother from Punjab. Growing up, he developed a love for music, especially Punjabi tunes. Although he pursued civil engineering at Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh, his passion for music led him to explore rap. Initially performing under the name “Cool Equal,” Badshah later changed his stage name and made his mark in the Indian music scene.\n\nHis big break came in 2006 when he began producing music and his popularity soared. His unique style, mixing hip-hop with Indian melodies, quickly gained a following.\n\nBadshah’s Career: From Humble Beginnings to Stardom\n\nBadshah's first major hit in Bollywood was \"Saturday Saturday\" from Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya. This song helped him rise to fame and set the stage for a successful career. Over the years, he has produced countless chart-topping songs, such as \"Tareefan,\" \"Paagal,\" and \"Genda Phool.\"\n\nIn 2019, Badshah made history when his song \"Paagal\" amassed over 74 million views within 24 hours. While this feat sparked some controversy about promotional tactics, it didn’t diminish the song’s popularity. Badshah has also released albums like The Power of Dreams of a Kid in 2020 and his latest, Ek Tha Raja in 2024, which became an instant success.\n\nBadshah’s Lavish Lifestyle: Cars and Houses\n\nBadshah’s wealth is reflected in his impressive collection of luxury cars. His garage includes some of the most expensive and prestigious vehicles, such as a Rolls Royce worth Rs 6.4 crore, a Lamborghini Gallardo priced at Rs 3.06 crore, G Wagon and a Porsche Cayman 718 valued at Rs 90 lakh. Additionally, he owns a Mercedes Benz S worth Rs 1.9 crore, a BMW 649D for Rs 1.15 crore, and a Lamborghini Urus priced at Rs 3 crore. He also has an Audi Q8 worth Rs 1.23 crore and a Jeep Wrangler worth Rs 60.35 lakh.\n\nBadshah’s real estate portfolio is equally impressive. He owns several properties, including a Rs 12 crore home in Delhi and Chandigarh, and a Rs 5 crore property in Mumbai. His investments extend beyond India, with properties in London, Dubai, and Pune. These luxurious homes reflect his success and status.\n\nSneakers worth Rs 22 lakh\n\nBadshah recently shared details about his vast sneaker collection, revealing that he owns more than 1000 pairs. He also spoke about his luxurious Rolls Royce, which is worth around Rs 8 crore, and mentioned a special pair of sneakers valued at Rs 22 lakh, which he plans to wear on stage if he wins a Grammy.\n\nIn an interview with The Lallantop, Badshah talked about his high-end cars, including a Rolls Royce and a G-Wagon, with the Rolls Royce estimated to be worth Rs 7-8 crore. However, despite owning these expensive cars, he admitted that he prefers simpler vehicles, saying, \"No car beats the Swift. Swift and Innova are the best.\"\n\nThe rapper also discussed his impressive sneaker collection, saying that the 500 pairs previously mentioned were an understatement. \"That's less. I probably have over 1000 pairs. I stopped counting after 500, but when I moved houses, I realised I had more than 1000. I only wear a few; the rest are just for display,\" he added.\n\nBadshah’s Family and Personal Life\n\nBadshah married Jasmine Masih in 2012, and together they had a daughter, Jessemy Grace Masih Singh, in 2017. However, they divorced in 2020. Despite his public persona, Badshah keeps his personal life private, focusing on being a good father to his daughter.\n\nBadshah’s Girlfriend: Rumoured Relationship with Hania Aamir\n\nRecently, Badshah has been in the news for his rumoured relationship with Pakistani actress Hania Aamir. The two were seen together at one of Badshah's concerts in Dubai, where Hania shared a touching moment with him. In a viral Instagram video, Hania greeted Badshah with folded hands, and the two shared a hug. The video sparked speculation about their relationship, with Hania calling him a \"rockstar\" in the caption.\n\nBadshah’s Legacy\n\nBadshah’s journey from a small-town boy to a rap icon is a testament to his hard work, talent, and determination. With numerous hit songs, a thriving career, and a lavish lifestyle, Badshah has become a role model for aspiring artists. As he celebrates his 39th birthday, there’s no doubt that Badshah’s impact on the music industry will continue to grow.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Badshah’s net worth is estimated at Rs 124 crore.\n\n- His career began with the song \"Saturday Saturday\" and has since flourished.\n\n- Badshah owns a range of luxury cars, including Rolls Royce and Lamborghini.\n\n- His properties include lavish homes in Delhi, Chandigarh, Mumbai, London, and Dubai.\n\n- Despite his success, Badshah maintains a private personal life, especially concerning his family and relationships.\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

		"title": "Children's Day 2024: Teach financial literacy to your kids in fun and practical ways",
		"text": "Children's Day’s special: Children's Day, celebrated on November 14 in India, marks the birth anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the nation's first Prime Minister, who was fondly called \"Chacha Nehru\" for his love for children. This day highlights children's rights, education, and overall well-being.\n\nBut why not go beyond celebrations this year and focus on something equally important? Use Children's Day 2024 as a chance to teach your kids the importance of financial literacy. Building financial literacy for kids from an early age equips them with skills they will rely on for a lifetime.\n\nHere are some easy and practical ways to instil financial knowledge in your children.\n\n1. Make Financial Learning Fun Through Games\n\nLearning doesn’t have to be boring! Use board games like Monopoly or The Game of Life to teach financial skills such as saving, planning, and negotiation.\n\nThese games simulate real-life financial scenarios, helping kids grasp concepts like paying rent, managing taxes, and handling investments. By turning lessons into play, you can teach financial literacy to kids in a way that feels enjoyable and memorable.\n\n2. Provide a Monthly Allowance to Teach Budgeting\n\nStart by giving your children a monthly allowance. This method encourages them to learn how to save and manage money. By allowing them to decide what to buy and how much to spend, they’ll quickly understand the value of budgeting.\n\nTo make it exciting, set a savings target for them. Offer small rewards, like extra pocket money, if they successfully meet their goal. This can motivate kids to plan their spending carefully and develop a saving habit early on.\n\n3. Money Responsibility\n\nManaging money responsibly involves keeping track of spending. It means knowing how much money you have, how much you’ve spent, and how much you need to save for the future.\n\nThis lesson helps young children understand the importance of managing money by learning to keep accurate records. It includes fun activities and worksheets that teach them how to track their spending and saving, encouraging accountability and smart money habits.\n\n4. Be a Role Model for Financial Discipline\n\nChildren learn best by observing their parents. Rather than lecturing them about money, lead by example.\n\nDiscuss your own experiences with money and involve them in everyday financial decisions, such as setting a household budget. Show them how you evaluate prices while shopping or compare deals to make cost-effective choices.\n\nFor a fun activity, give them a set amount during shopping and ask them to select useful items within that budget. This interactive approach helps them understand the importance of thoughtful spending.\n\n5. Turn Grocery Shopping Into Financial Lessons\n\nEveryday activities, like grocery shopping, can become valuable learning experiences. Before heading to the store, ask your children to create their own shopping list. At the store, give them simple tasks, such as calculating the cost of half a kilo of apples or finding cheaper alternatives for an item on the list.\n\nChallenge them to stick to a small budget while picking items they genuinely need. These hands-on lessons in money management and decision-making will stay with them long after the trip.\n\n6. Open a Bank Account for Your Kids\n\nIntroduce your children to the banking world by opening a savings account for them. Many banks offer special accounts for minors, either as joint accounts or under parental supervision.\n\nDeposit a fixed amount as pocket money each month, and encourage them to save a portion of it. To keep their interest alive, you can even offer a \"parental interest\" incentive—an extra sum added to their savings if they meet their monthly targets.\n\nThis not only makes saving exciting but also introduces them to the power of compounding. Watching their bank balance grow over time teaches valuable lessons about earning, saving, and managing money.\n\nWhy Financial Literacy Matters for Kids\n\nFinancial literacy for kids is about more than just numbers. It builds confidence, decision-making skills, and a sense of responsibility. Starting early ensures that children grow up understanding how to manage their finances effectively, making them better prepared for adult life.\n\nThis Children's Day, take the opportunity to blend celebrations with meaningful lessons. By introducing financial tips for kids into their daily routine, you’re gifting them the knowledge that will benefit them forever.\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

		"title": "Breast cancer survivor Chhavi Mittal praises Hina Khan for battling the condition with grace; 9 mental health tips for patients",
		"text": "Hina Khan has been courageously fighting cancer and her struggle has become a beacon of hope for many. Celebrities like Mouni Roy, Ekta Kapoor, Sunil Grover, and others lauded her for being such a strong woman. In an inclusive interview with ToI, actress Chhavi Mittal praised Hina Khan for her strength and the way she is gracefully handling her battle with breast cancer.\n\nChhavi Mittal on Hina Khan\n\nExclusively speaking to ToI, Chhavi shared, \"I had a brief chat with her, and she’s doing well. Having been through this myself, I understand it’s a deeply personal journey, and every survivor or fighter should decide what their safe space is. I reached out to her and told her that if she ever wants to share something with a fellow survivor, I’m here for her. We had a very sweet and meaningful conversation, and I left it at that.\"\n\nAccording to Chhavi, Hina is handling her condition really well. Since she experienced that struggle, she felt her battle. Mittal said, she also felt that continuing to work amid such conditions was a good decision, as the journey feels a bit less overwhelming compared to when there’s nothing to do. And Hina is doing the same, which is a great approach as per Mittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, actress Chhavi Mittal revealed her battle with early-stage breast cancer, which shocked her fans. It was a hard journey for her, but she bravely fought the deadly disease.\n\nCancer is the leading cause of death across the globe. “Receiving a breast cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming and challenging. At this point, it is important to understand that it’s normal to feel these emotions. Overcoming an emotional turmoil such as breast cancer involves several strategies,” says Ms. Praagnya A, Psycho-oncologist, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore.\n\n9 mental health tips for breast cancer patients\n\nAsk for help: Get support from your friends, family, and the circle of your loved ones. Social assistance is an essential component of the emotional state of a patient on treatment for cancer.\n\nEngage in self-care practices: Involve yourself in relaxing exercises such as meditation, yoga, listening to a podcast, or reading a book to feel relaxed.\n\nExpress emotions: journaling, and expressing your feelings through art, poetry, music, or any other form of creative expression would aid in releasing suppressed emotions.\n\nPractice mindfulness: Concentrate on the present rather than the past or future. Focusing on and completely involving yourself in everything you do can help you feel calm and comfortable.\n\nEducate yourself: Discuss your concerns regarding treatment with the treating team in order to know more about the interventions, adverse effects, and reviews.\n\nMaintain a routine: Engage in normal day-to-day activities and pursuits to maintain feelings of normality and a sense of direction.\n\nCelebrate milestones: Celebrate your progress and the concluding phase of your treatment to lift your spirits and morale.\n\n⁠Join support groups: Connect with a breast cancer support group to share your experience and to feel a sense of connection, inspiration and support from others going through a similar journey.\n\nSeek professional help: Reach out to a professional for better direction, guidance, and a different perspective.\n\nRemember that you are not alone. These strategies, coupled with love, hope, and strength, can get you through this challenging journey.",

		"title": "AR Rahman separation: Are celeb marriages the new fairytale gone wrong? Psychiatrists list reasons behind rise in divorce cases",
		"text": "The separation announcement of the legendary music composer AR Rahman and his wife Saira Banu has blown the internet. From netizens on X (formerly called Twitter) to the Instagram fam, everyone can’t stop talking about it. Nearly after three decades of marriage, the couple decided to end the relationship, and the decision was not easy to make.\n\nAR Rahman pens an emotional message for fans\n\nIn an emotional post on X Rahman expressed that he was expecting a 'grand thirty'. He wrote,\n\n“We had hoped to reach the grand thirty, but all things, it seems, carry an unseen end. Even the throne of God might tremble at the weight of broken hearts. Yet, in this shattering, we seek meaning, though the pieces may not find their place again. To our friends, thank you for your kindness and for respecting our privacy as we walk through this fragile chapter.”\n\n#arrsairaabreakup\n\n“We had hoped to reach the grand thirty, but all things, it seems, carry an unseen end. Even the throne of God might tremble at the weight of broken hearts. Yet, in this shattering, we seek meaning, though the pieces may not find their place again. To our friends, thank you for… — A.R.Rahman (@arrahman) November 19, 2024\n\nAR Rahman's divorce has once again brought the celebrity world and their relationships under scanner. As shocking as it may sound, the reality is that most celebrity couples, from Hrithik Roshan and Sussane Khan to Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya, announced their separation after almost spending forever together.\n\nHigh-profile separations—Has the idea of marriage lost its spark?\n\nWhen we discuss marriage, we often see it through the lens of idealism, romanticising the notion of eternal love and commitment. Yet, the rising cases of separation—especially among the celebrities, whom we often look up to—raises questions about the true idea of marriage.\n\nAre these high-profile separations forcing us to reconsider whether the concept of marriage is enduring enough or not?\n\nWhy do long-term marriages fail?\n\nIn India, the divorce rate has risen steadily in recent years. Dr. Sanjay Chugh, Senior Consultant Neuro-Psychiatrist based in Delhi, says, “Most of the time, couples get bored of each other in long-term marriages. They start living a monotonous and repetitive life. This monotony and boredom trigger the thought of getting out of the marriage.”\n\n“In a long-term marriage, people start taking each other for granted, and usually, the onus is put on the other person to rectify things. They rarely introspect to see what went wrong in their relationship. The longer the relationship, the higher the stress,” adds Dr Chug.\n\nToxic relationships are the major driving force behind various issues between a couple. According to Dr. Sonal Anand, psychiatrist at Wockhardt Hospitals Mira Road, “The factors or reasons could be multiple, including a lack of communication, too much control or restriction, manipulation, disrespect, unrealistic expectations, and emotional dependency.”\n\n5 mental tips to manage toxic relationships\n\nPoor communication between couples is one of the most common factors that leads to misunderstandings, flights, and frustrations. “This can be actively managed by making simple changes in a relationship; this may include expressing thoughts or feelings without getting hyper and keeping the temper in control,” says Dr. Anand.\n\nControlling and manipulative behaviour by one of the partners can be overwhelming and stressful, which makes you feel suffocated.\n\nSet boundaries: It becomes very important to set boundaries and take a stand for yourself whenever needed.\n\nRespect each other: A relationship without respect is nothing! Try to be respectful irrespective of their tone or language; it can feel more like a liability than a relationship.\n\nAddress the issue: Individuals should address this issue firmly without any hesitation. When the relationship is filled with unrealistic expectations, it can create imbalance or extreme pressure.\n\nAim for realistic expectations: Focus on building a relationship based on fair and realistic expectations while openly vocalising your needs to maintain a healthy balance.\n\nPrioritise your mental health: Remember, always prioritise your mental health first. If the relationship still seems toxic even after continuous efforts, then do not hesitate to take a break or get out of it, as it can take a heavy toll on your mental health if neglected.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"title": "Five years after COVID-19, new study reveals virus may ‘shrink cancerous tumours’",
		"text": "COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the world, killing millions, but have you ever thought that it could be a silver lining for cancer patients? In a recent study, scientists found that the coronavirus strain can fight cancer.\n\nResearch conducted at the Northwestern Medicine Canning Thoracic Institute found that COVID-19 may help shrink the cancerous tumours, the study is likely to be published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation later this month.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors surprisingly found that some cancer patients who were affected by the virus noticed that their tumours grew smaller or more slowly as compared to other cancer patients.\n\nThe study goes on to quote Dr. Ankit Bharat, the chief of thoracic surgery at Northwestern University, who revealed that they did not realise whether it was real as patients in the hospital were so ill. \"Was it because the immune system was so triggered by the COVID-19 virus that it started killing the cancer cells? What was it?” he posed. This coincidence led the researchers and Dr. Bharat’s team to investigate the matter and find out the answers.\n\nThe surprising link between COVID-19 and cancer tumours\n\nCOVID-19 and cancer tumours share an unexpected link by offering promising results for cancer cure. Researchers have discovered that the Covid-19 virus can trigger the immune system to attack cancer cells. If the results have the potential, then this can turn out to be an innovative treatment inspired for cancer, as per the researchers.\n\nAccording to Dr. Bharat and his team, when SARS-CoV-2 is present, a type of immune cell behaves differently. Generally, the monocytes aid the immune system by passing through the bloodstream and alerting other immune cells when they detect foreign cells or dangers. Moreover, the protection effect changes in the presence of SARS-CoV-2, potentially allowing the immune system to fight the cancer cells more effectively.\n\nRNA in the COVID-19 virus triggers the development of unique immune cells\n\nLater, the study also found that the RNA within the COVID-19 virus triggers the development of a unique immune cell that has the ability to fight cancer. Those cells are then able to travel and target the cancer cells inside tumours.\n\nThe study findings are promising as these will help in developing a breakthrough treatment for common cancers such as melanoma, breast, lung, and colon cancer.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"title": "Clocking in extra hours at work? Beware—experts warn of high risk of developing diabetes",
		"text": "Working for long hours has become a normal routine for the majority of the population across the globe. But did you know that long working hours can have detrimental effects on your overall health? Studies have found that extended working hours can lead to chronic diseases, including diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetes is the leading public health concern across the globe, including India, with an estimated count of 74.9 million people living with diabetes, mainly among the age group of 20-79 years in 2021. By 2045, the estimated number is projected to jump to 124.9 million. In the current times, multiple factors are contributing to the rise in diabetes incidences, including lack of physical activities, stress, poor or sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and alcohol consumption. But how is diabetes linked to long working hours?\n\nA study published in the BMJ Diabetes Research & Care found a link between long working hours and the risk of developing diabetes among men. It found that working 45 hours or more a week is linked to a higher risk of diabetes among women but not men.\n\nCredit: Pexels\n\nLong working hours often lead to irregular eating habits, lack of physical activity, and lack of adequate sleep, all of which play a role in diabetes development. “Stress triggers the release of hormones like cortisol, which can cause insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Additionally, extended hours of desk work promote a sedentary lifestyle, reducing the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively,” explains Dr. Pranav Ghody, an American-trained and board-certified endocrinologist at the Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central.\n\nLong Hours, Big Risks: How do long working hours lead to diabetes?\n\nResearch shows that working over 45 hours a week can lead to chronic stress, poor sleep, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, including irregular meal times, physical inactivity, and inadequate nutrition.\n\nDr. Anusha Nadig, Consultant, Endocrinology, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore, says, “Long working hours can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This can disrupt insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and hormonal balance, ultimately contributing to diabetes. Regular breaks, exercise, and healthy habits can help mitigate this risk.”\n\nCredit: Pexels\n\nStudies have shown that individuals working more than 55 hours per week are at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those with standard work hours. Women, in particular, may face a greater risk due to hormonal fluctuations and the additional stress of balancing work and family responsibilities.\n\nWith long working hours, poor lifestyle and eating habits are major contributors\n\nPoor eating habits, such as skipping meals or consuming high-calorie, processed foods during work hours, further contribute to weight gain and metabolic issues. According to Dr. Ghody, \"Irregular meal timings disrupt the body’s insulin response, leading to spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. Sleep deprivation, another common consequence of long working hours, often leads to consumption of high-calorie foods due to extra time awake, ultimately impacting glucose metabolism and increasing the risk of insulin resistance.”\n\nCredit: Pexels\n\nTo mitigate these risks, adopting a healthy work-life balance is crucial. Incorporating regular breaks for movement, eating balanced meals, managing stress through relaxation techniques, and prioritising adequate sleep can significantly lower the likelihood of diabetes.\n\nConsulting healthcare professionals for periodic health check-ups and early interventions can also play a pivotal role in preventing the onset of diabetes and ensuring long-term health despite demanding work schedules.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"text": "On International Men's Day, let's take a moment to honour the invaluable contributions of men to our society, families, and communities. Today, we celebrate not only the strength and resilience men show but also their compassion, wisdom, and mental well-being. This year's International Men's Day theme is \"positive male role models\" to highlight the importance of fostering positive relationships and promoting mental health among men.\n\nThe importance of men’s mental health—both at the workplace and at home—cannot be overstated. Globally, around 12 billion working days are lost each year to depression and anxiety alone, costing an estimated US$ 1 trillion each year of lost productivity, reported the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAs per the report, it is evident that men are significantly less likely to seek help for mental health challenges. Moreover, alcohol abuse, depression, and specific phobias are among the most common mental health disorders affecting men, and the global suicide rate is over twice as high among men than women, underscoring the severity of this issue.\n\n“Men are more vulnerable to societal pressures and stigma, causing them to suffer in silence, pressure to stay strong and unaffected. They also avoid seeking help for mental health from the people around them. On this International Men’s Day, we urge you to recognise these challenges and act upon them,” says Dr Vikram Vora, Medical Director and Chief Health Officer (Indian Subcontinent) at International SOS.\n\nOrganisations can play an important role in this by providing an environment where mental health is nurtured and prioritised.\n\nWhat steps should workplaces take to address the issue?\n\nOrganisations should indulge in providing counselling sessions for their employees, training for managers, and peer support programs to enhance the mental well-being of their staff.\n\nIn every organisation, male employees should be vocal about their problems and discuss them with their immediate managers to resolve them. According to Dr. Vora, “Workplaces should strive towards providing a supportive work culture, try to normalise the disturbed behaviours of their employees by providing counselling, and empower male employees to prioritise their mental well-being.”\n\nWhat Men Face:\n\n1) Career challenges are often mapped to meeting expectations of parents and peers.\n\n2) A happily married life is what most men man in India have been conditioned to seek as a benchmark of “a happy life”.\n\n3) Making ends meet, if not luxurious.\n\n4) The longing for validation and appreciation from friends, workplace colleagues, and family.\n\nOthers include:\n\nAs time goes on, challenges keep getting tougher with newer goals.\n\nExpectations from family members.\n\nThe organisational environment plays a big role.\n\nDr. Roshan Mansukhani (HC), Founder and Therapist at Music—A Holistic Heal, Mumbai, points out, “Like women, men too have their share of problems that can be very disturbing but can't be spoken about or addressed due to the stigma surrounding the topic of mental health.” He shares some ways to tackle the situation:\n\nHow should organisations tackle this?\n\n1) Have bi-monthly wellness sessions in office spaces for employees.\n\n2) Welcome the families of employees at least twice a year to the office.\n\n3) Assign a therapist or counsellor to visit the office at least once a week. Make sure the chamber or cabin is a closed one and not with a glass partition alone. People want to be heard. Someone they can confide in, someone who won't judge them.\n\nAddressing the underlying stress shall increase productivity. It shall help to strike a balance between the personal and professional front.\n\n4) Have some nice music played on the office floor for 7 minutes every morning as they come to work as that sets the mood for the day ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"title": "International Men's Day 2024: How do air pollution and toxins impact male fertility? Experts decode",
		"text": "On November 19, every year the world celebrates International Men's Day! On this day, the spotlight is on all the incredible men who make a difference in big and small ways, whether they are mentors, friends, or brothers!\n\nOn International Men's Day, while we celebrate the achievements and strength of men, it is also important to talk about the unique health challenges that they go through. One such silent yet significant threat is the rising air pollution levels. Air pollution in Delhi has already wreaked havoc, posing a major threat to our health, but did you know that air pollution impacts sperm quality in men?\n\nWell, there is mounting evidence that environmental toxins, rising air pollution, and harmful substances in the air have dropped the fertility rates among men. According to studies, sperm quality can be impacted due to excessive exposure to pollutants, including particulate matter and heavy metal particles. “These factors can impair sperm quality and its concentration, morphology (form and shape), and motility (the capability to move efficiently), which will impact their ability to reproduce,” says Dr. Nilesh Unmesh Balkawade, Regional Medical Head & Fertility Specialist.\n\nHow does air pollution impact sperm quality?\n\nResearch shows men exposed to high toxins may experience up to a 30% higher risk of being infertile. Additionally, poor lifestyle habits like smoking, poor diet, and stress can also be contributing factors.\n\nDr. Balkawade explains, “The accumulation of oxygen species in the body because of exposure to pollution also contributes to oxidative stress. This type of damage does not affect the quality of sperm DNA. Also interferes with the hormonal equilibrium necessary for sperm creation. Also, long-term exposure to noise pollution has been linked to testosterone levels, which can additionally affect fertility levels and decrease them.”\n\nMale fertility is declining across the globe due to multiple factors, including environmental pollution and toxin exposure. “The driving factor includes air pollution (PM2.5 and PM10), heavy metals like lead and cadmium, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (BPA and phthalates). Fine particulate matter triggers oxidative stress and hormonal imbalances, significantly reducing sperm concentration and motility,” as per Dr. Prasanta Kumar Nayak, Clinical Head & Fertility Specialist, at Oasis Fertility.\n\nMoreover, industrial emissions, plastic, and contaminated water also deplete sperm quality and its DNA functions.\n\nTips to prevent the risk\n\nPeople can fight this by emphasising diets high in antioxidants, consistent exercise, quitting smoking, and limiting their exposure to toxins. More broadly, stronger environmental laws are essential to limiting dangerous substances and lowering pollution, adds Dr Nayak.\n\nTo safeguard future generations and reproductive health, these challenges must be addressed.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"title": "Peanut lovers, beware! Experts warn excess consumption can trigger inflammation and weight gain",
		"text": "Peanuts are believed to be rich in nutritional value, just like other valuable nuts like almonds, walnuts, or cashews. Surprisingly, peanuts do not belong to the nut family. They are classified as legumes along with foods like green peas, soybeans, and lentils. But did you know that a popular snack that is great in taste has potential side effects?\n\nPeanuts are considered nutritious due to the exceptional benefits they have to offer. They are known to contain heart-healthy fats, protein, and essential vitamins, though they should be eaten in moderation daily. According to the Mayo Clinic, regular consumption of peanuts can lead to various types of allergies.\n\n“Peanuts can be eaten as a snack due to their high protein and fibre content. The benefits of peanuts for your health can decrease when eaten in larger quantities or in excess. They are packed with calories, causing weight gain. Peanuts contain omega-6 fatty acids, which in excess can contribute to inflammation in the body,” says Dr Aarti Ullal, physician and diabetologist at Gleneagles Hospital Parel.\n\nHowever, the snack is popularly considered nutritious due to the exceptional benefits they have to offer. They are known to contain heart-healthy fats, protein, and essential vitamins, though they should be eaten in moderation daily.\n\nCredit: Pixabay\n\nPeanuts can be harmful if not consumed in moderation; know the side effects\n\nDr. Ullal warns that for individuals with peanut allergies, even small daily exposures can trigger reactions, potentially leading to breathing problems, rashes on the skin, acid reflux, headaches, wheezing, coughing, and itching around the mouth and throat to anaphylaxis.\n\nOne has to be cautious, as peanuts can be addictive because of the fat content that drives dopamine in our brains. It is better to watch out for the quantity and stick to the instructions given by the expert.\n\nOn the other hand, “A large number of people will experience bloating, gas, or other digestive discomforts from regular peanut consumption. Peanuts contain omega-6 fatty acids, which in excess can contribute to inflammation in the body. Shockingly, the high-fat content in peanuts may put one at risk of gallstones in some individuals,” highlights Dr Anjali Shinde, Clinical Nutritionist, Ankura Hospital for Women and Children, Pune.\n\nPeanut allergy can also lead to breathing problems, rashes on the skin, acid reflux, headaches, wheezing, coughing, and itching around the mouth and throat. One has to be cautious, as peanuts can cause addiction.\n\nCredit: Pixabay\n\nThe daily recommendation of consuming peanuts as per experts\n\nPeanuts can wreak havoc on your health when eaten in larger quantities. They are jam-packed with calories, causing weight gain. According to Dr. Ullal, “One can eat them 2 to 3 times a month. For those with peanut allergies, even small daily exposures can trigger severe reactions, potentially leading to anaphylaxis. It is better to watch out for the quantity and stick to the instructions given by the expert.”\n\nTimely intervention is key to overcoming problems related to peanut allergies. Stay vigilant when it comes to your health, as anything in excess is dangerous to your health.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"title": "Delhi AQI dips to 'severe category': Experts warn inhaling toxic air increases heart attack risk, check tips to prevent it",
		"text": "Air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) continues to be a significant threat. The national capital breathed the most toxic air on Monday morning, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) levels standing at 481 and being in the 'severe plus' category (450+) at all places.\n\nAccording to Swiss air technology firm IQAir, AQI readings across the city ranged from 1,300 to 1,600 on Monday morning. The depleting AQI levels forced the authorities to implement Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). This is considered an emergency-level action that is focused on reducing the air pollution levels in the city.\n\nThe toxic air quality and smog have crossed past 60 times the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended daily maximum levels. Realising the dangerous effects of air pollution, the schools in Delhi have switched to online classes until further notification. However, earlier, the government also took initiatives to curb air pollution, but still, reports have confirmed that smog has led to thousands of premature deaths every year, particularly impacting the health of children and the elderly.\n\nThe air pollution in Delhi demands a peaceful, mass protest on the streets. The air we breathe is lethally toxic. A new born baby in Delhi is heart-wrenchingly born with smoker’s lungs today. Tragically, people are already numb to this, almost as if they’re resigned to this slow… — Saurav Das (@SauravDassss) November 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAir pollution raises the risk of heart attacks\n\nExperts have warned that exposure to poor air quality significantly increases the risk of heart attacks. “Particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) pollutants trigger inflammation, damage blood vessels, and disrupt cardiovascular function. Even short-term exposure can cause cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and thrombosis,” says Dr Pavan Rasalkar, Consultant-Interventional Cardiology, Fortis Hospital, Nagarbhavi.\n\nPeople with pre-existing heart conditions, diabetes, and older adults are most vulnerable. Reducing exposure and adopting clean lifestyle habits can help mitigate this risk. Poor air quality, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants, increases the risk of heart attacks. Polluted air can increase BP and cause oxidative stress, all of which can affect cardiovascular health.\n\nThe price of air pollution is paid by our lungs 🫁 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/o0a1LQkoin — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) November 14, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nTips to protect your heart amid rising air pollution\n\nTrack the air quality levels: To better prepare yourself for reducing these potential risks and protecting your heart, it is important to keep track of air quality. This can easily be done by using apps or visiting websites.\n\nDo not step out until needed: In addition, try to avoid outdoor activities when the quality of air is poor. If you suffer from some heart condition, you should avoid outside workout sessions.\n\nUse air purifiers: Using purifiers can reduce the pollutant level indoors. With regard to exercise, avoid outdoor workouts in a polluted environment and go for indoor activities or well-ventilated gyms.\n\nUse N95 mask: One may safely use necessary masks in polluted areas, such as an N95 respirator that filters out harmful particles.\n\nFollow a healthy routine: Maintaining an out-and-out lifestyle of healthiness is also important; frequent physical activities, proper sleep habits, and stress management will strengthen cardiovascular health. Moreover, smoking should be avoided because it aggravates the adverse effects of air pollution on the heart.\n\nEat healthy: Follow an overall well-balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids as they help protect heart health.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

		"text": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) continues to remain in the ' very severe' category on Sunday in Delhi and the National Capital Regions. There was no sort of relief for the residents as they again woke up to the thick blanket of smog.\n\nThe rising air pollution is a threat to health across all age groups, affecting the lungs, heart, brain, eyes, and skin. Amid such conditions, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has advised people to minimise their travel during the severe air quality levels outside.\n\nDespite the depleting air quality levels to the ' severe' category and people staying inside their homes for days now, they are choosing to step out and continue their everyday routine, such as outside, running, morning walks, early morning exercises, workouts, and yoga. But how safe is that?\n\nMorning walks are beneficial for physical and mental health, but during times of high air pollution, they can exacerbate respiratory problems. Pollutants like fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are higher during early morning hours due to cooler temperatures and less wind.\n\n“These toxic particles can enter the lungs and cause irritation, inflammation, breathing problems, and even asthma or tuberculosis,” says Dr. Renu Soni, consultant-pulmonologist, at NIIMS Medical College, Greater Noida.\n\nAre morning walks safe amid rising air pollution?\n\nAir pollution poses a serious risk to the heart, especially for those with existing cardiovascular conditions who are at higher risk. Inhaling polluted air raises the risk of inflammation levels in the blood vessels, which increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nAccording to Dr. Shrey Srivastava, Senior Consultant, Sharda Hospital, Greater Noida, “If air quality levels (measured by AQI) are in the unhealthy range, it is better to stay indoors and exercise. Try to avoid doing outdoor physical activities.”\n\nTips to stay safe amid air pollution\n\nWear an N95 mask: Always consider using or wearing an N95 mask and avoid high-traffic areas if walking outdoors is unavoidable.\n\nDo not step out until required: Alternatively, you can also choose to stay inside to stay fit without risking your health, advises Dr. Soni.\n\nExercise in a well-ventilated space: Walking inside a well-ventilated area or using a treadmill instead is a safer option as compared to others.\n\nHydration is key: Drink water and keep yourself hydrated, as it can help mitigate the risk of the ill effects of air pollution.\n\nEat green vegetables: Consuming green vegetables and antioxidant-rich foods can help mitigate the harmful effects of pollution.\n\nFor more on lifestyle, astrology and health from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

Today, on her 51st birthday, let's take a closer look at her equation with her son and the 5 valuable lessons we can learn from her parenting style.\n\nValuable things we can learn from Malaika Arora's parenting style\n\n1) Open communication\n\nMalaika Arora has often gone on record saying that she talks to her son about almost everything. Whether it is about each other's romantic relationship or keeping each other up-to-date with what is going on in their life as celebrities who are constantly in the public eye. Even when she appeared on Arhaan's new podcast Dunb Biryani, Malaika was the ultimate cool mom who did not shy away from having difficult conversations.\n\n2) Cordial co-parenting with ex-husband\n\nMalaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan tied the knot in 1998 and welcomed their son Arhaan in 2002. Even after parting ways in 2017, Malaika maintained a friendly relationship with her ex-husband, who got visitation rights to their son in the divorce settlement while Malaika was granted primary custody. In an interview, Malaika shared that while initially, she found it tricky co-parenting her son with her ex, she has now realised that whatever happened is in the past and it can not continue to affect their lives any longer or how they treat their son.\n\nAfter their divorce, Arbaaz got married to Sshura Khan and Malaika also dated Arjun Kapoor for several years before the duo broke up.\n\n3) Becoming friends with your children\n\nIn a recent interview, Malaika shared that even though she is s bit strict with her son, she has now found a balance in becoming his friend. She shared that she does not want her son to be afraid of sharing anything with her, rather she wants him to feel confident enough that he can come up and share anything and everything with her and his go-to reaction should be, \"I want to tell mom about this.\"\n\n4) Going against societal norms\n\nMalaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan parted ways after a 19-year-long marriage. The Kaal actress shared it was a tumultuous time in her life and the decision did not come lightly. She revealed she was worried about what society was going to say, what her parents would think or how it was going to affect her son Arhaan. Even though she was 'frightened', she took the bold step with the hope that it would be good for all three of them in the long run.\n\n5) Independence\n\nTime and time again, Malaika has highlighted the importance of being independent and self-reliant. She recently shared in an interview that her son Arhaan's friends are confused about what she actually does because she has donned so many hats in her long and illustrious career. For the uninitiated, Malaika has worked as a model, a VJ, an actress and even a reality TV judge. Through her career, Malaika has highlighted the importance of being financially independent and to life on one's own terms.\n\nFor more on celeb lifestyle, relationships and fashion from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.\n\n",

		"title": "Five questions to STOP asking in 2024! Enhance genuine conversations and deeper relationships",
		"text": "As we step into 2025, it's time to reassess the way we communicate and connect with one another. t's high time we need to STOP scrutinising people, STOP putting them on pressure, STOP being intrusive, STOP being outdated. Every time you want to communicate to someone, please reassess in your head the flow of the conversation and what might tick the other person. Please be a little more sensitive with people who are your friends, family and acquaintance.\n\nThese 5 questions need to DISAPPEAR this year and in the coming years from all age groups.\n\n1. Why aren't you getting married or divorce?\n\nIt might be just a topic of discussion for you but it's a big part of their life. So avoid mentioning it.\n\n2. Skin and hair problem\n\nSomeone who is going through this is already going through stress. If you pinpoint their insecurity, you are only adding to their stress. Why be that person?\n\nCredit; Pinterest\n\n3. Weight gain and weight loss\n\nQuestions about someone's body can be triggering and may perpetuate harmful societal standards around weight and appearance. First of all, they know about their body. Secondly, it's insensitive to comment on it. Thirdly, don't be that person people avoid meeting in future.\n\n\n\n4 Why aren't you having kids?\n\nIn today's age, it's a huge responsibility and decision to have a child, so it should be none of anyone's business.\n\n\n\nCredit: Pinterest\n\n5. Stop commenting on someone's personality\n\nWhy do you walk like this? Why do you sit like a man? You do know that comes under bullying. In 2024 and in the coming years, let’s strive for better, genuine conversations that foster understanding and connections.\n\nFor more such stories on relationships, follow us on Indiatimes Lifestyle\n\n",

		"text": "From sharing that they are going to welcome a child to introducing their daughter to the world, Ranbir and Alia have come a long way in their parenting journey. Since it's Ranbir Kapoor's birthday today, let's take a look at five times when the Animal actor proved he's the ultimate girl dad to his daughter Raha Kapoor. Beginning with singing lullabies and reading her to sleep to playing self-invented games with her exploring fabrics,\n\nRanbir and Raha moments that prove he's the ultimate girl dad\n\n1) When he learned Raha's Malayalam lullaby\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Alia's recent appearance on The Great Indian Kapil Show on Netflix, she shared how Ranbir invents the cutest games to play with Raha. She also revealed their daughter's nurse sings her a Malayam lullaby 'Unni va vavo' when she wants to go to sleep. As a kid, Raha asks the same lullaby to be sung to her by parents! In a heartwarming turn of events, Alia shared Ranbir has actually learned the Malayam song for his daughter and now often sings it for her.\n\n2) When he took a stroll holding Raha's hand\n\nEarlier in June this year Alia shared an adorable moment between the daddy-daughter duo on her Instagram. The photo taken from both their backs, shows Ranbir and Raha walking hand-in-hand as they take a leisurely stroll along the cobblestone streets during their vacation. This photo shares a glimpse into the duo's close relationship like any father shares with their toddler.\n\n3) When he shared the 'politics' he's playing at home\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an interview, Ranbir shared that when Raha was born he was busy shooting Animal and could not spend as much time with her. But after completing that schedule, he has taken a 5-6 month long paternity leave to spend time with his daughter. He shared their everyday shenanigans with her then 7-month-old daughter and also revealed he keeps telling her nurse to say 'papa' first because he wants to be her daughter's favourite.\n\n4) When he got Raha's name tattooed\n\nWhile Ranbir's hairstylist Aalim Hakim shared some smoking hot pictures of the dad featuring his endless abs to flaunt his latest haircut, eagle-eyed fans spotted something else entirely! A tattoo! Yes, you read that right, the Rockstar actor has gotten inked with her daughter's name on his neck. The simple tattoo is a clear indication of the immense love he has for his daughter!\n\n5) When he kept holding her during her first media introduction\n\nComing back to where it all actually started, the first time we ever saw Raha's face! It was Kapoor Khandan's annual Christmas lunch where Ranbir and Alia brought their daughter along for a photo session after attending the festivities. This blue-eyed little girl instantly mesmerized the internet and the fascination still seems to be going strong! The most wholesome thing about the outing was how Ranbir constantly kept carrying his little girl around. And even when he bent down to make her stand for the photos, she refused to step out of his arms!\n\nFrom juggling his time with her in between his shoots to taking time off from his work so Alia could shoot for her films, Ranbir is literally daddy goals!\n\nAlso Read: Ranbir Kapoor's birthday: Top 6 moments when the Animal actor proved he's a football fanatic\n\nFor more on celeb lifestyle and fashion from around the world please visit Indiatimes Lifestyle.\n\n",

		"text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan is not just a style icon and a movie star but she's also a mother of two boys. Married to an iconic actor Saif Ali Khan, Kareena is also step mother to Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim. The ' Buckingham Murders' actor Kareena has done a pretty fine job in juggling between two sets of children.\n\n\n\nIn some of her earlier interviews and Koffee With Karan, Kareena has mentioned that she doesn't treat Sara and Ibrahim like kids but as friends. Saif added that most of the times Sara and Kareena team up together.\n\nWell, full credit to Kareena for handling the family so well. When it comes to her own children, Taimur and Jeh, Kareena knows motherhood is a full time job and it can take a toll on your mental and physical health. In her case, two boys, can be a handful, however, Kareena at no point, feels she is not doing enough.\n\nInfact, Kareena sent out an empowering message to all mothers who are struggling with their children at different stages in life. She reposted an important message for moms.\n\nCredit: Instagram/Kareena Kapoor\n\nKareena reposted this message that read: \"Babies cry. Toddlers have tantrums. Kids talk back. Teenagers test boundaries. None of this means you're failing.\" She wrote, \"Good morning and read that again.\"\n\n'You are not failing', Kareena wants each mother to know that its not her. With parenting styles constantly evolving, it can get extremely draining for a new mother to keep with times, too many opinions, suggestions and complains.\n\nKareena actually tells you that no one else would! To all the mothers, young and old, you are amazing. On the work front, Kareena Kapoor's movie The Buckingham Murders opened to limited opening and audience response.\n\nFor more such stories on celebs and relationships, follow us on Indiatimes Lifestyle.\n\n\n\n",

		"title": "Nick Jonas birthday: 5 times he & wife Priyanka Chopra proved they’re relationship goals",
		"text": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra have always been the picture-perfect couple in the spotlight. Their relationship isn’t just about grand gestures; it’s the small, everyday moments that truly set them apart. On Nick's birthday today, here’s a look at five ways this power couple has shown us what true relationship goals look like.\n\n1) Cheerleaders in Each Other’s Lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick and Priyanka are each other’s biggest supporters. Whether it’s Priyanka’s new project like Citadel or Nick’s musical endeavors, they are always there to cheer each other on. Priyanka has often praised Nick’s talent and hard work in interviews and social media posts, while Nick doesn’t shy away from showcasing his admiration for Priyanka’s impressive career and achievements. Their genuine support for each other’s professional milestones is a testament to their strong bond.\n\n2) Quality Time Together\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite their busy schedules, Nick and Priyanka make it a point to spend quality time together. They’re often seen enjoying holidays in exotic locations, taking relaxing vacations, or just chilling at home. Their ability to carve out time for each other amidst their hectic work lives shows their commitment and the importance they place on nurturing their relationship.\n\n3) Public Displays of Affection\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to showing their love, Nick and Priyanka are never shy. From heartfelt posts on social media to public displays of affection at events, they are always open about their love for each other. Their glamorous appearance at events like the Ambani cruise party, where they shared affectionate moments and posed together, adds a personal touch to their public image. These displays of affection make their love story all the more relatable and endearing.\n\n4) Celebrating Wins Together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick and Priyanka don’t just celebrate the big milestones; they also cherish the small victories. Whether it’s a new project, a personal achievement, or simply a memorable day, they make it a point to celebrate together. This shared joy in each other’s successes reinforces their partnership and highlights their mutual respect and admiration.\n\n5) Embracing Each Other’s Traditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most beautiful aspects of their relationship is how they immerse themselves in each other’s cultural traditions. Priyanka and Nick have celebrated a range of festivals together, from Indian festivities like Holi and Diwali to Christmas, blending their cultural practices. Their participation in each other's traditions not only shows their respect for one another’s backgrounds but also deepens their connection.\n\nIn a world where high-profile relationships can often seem superficial, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra’s genuine affection and commitment to each other offer a refreshing perspective. Their ability to support, celebrate, and embrace each other’s worlds makes them a couple that truly embodies relationship goals.",

		"text": "Bollywood actor and judge Esha Deol has spoken about her family dynamics many a times. Her relationship with Sunny Deol or her father has always been under scrutiny but Esha has never shied away from discussing their family and the relationships they currently share.\n\nIn an old viral video when Esha was a judge at Roadies, one participant was asked about Esha Deol's father during the audition. Well, the answer will shock you. She said, \"Sunny Deol.\" Take a look.\n\nEsha was left in splits along with fellow judge and she was obviously rejected. Well, Esha in a new interview recalled her relationship with her father Dharmendra.\n\nDeol family dynamic explained\n\nFor those who don't know, Dharmendra married his first wife Prakash Kaur in 1954 at the age of 19 before he joined the movie business. The couple even welcomed four children together – Sunny, Bobby Vijeeta and Ajeeta. Without separation, Dharmendra married dream girl Hema Malini in 1980. The actor also has two daughters – Esha and Ahana – with actress Hema Malini.\n\nCredit: Pinterest/ dharmendra-and-esha\n\nSpeaking about the relationship, Esha shared with her father at a teenager was not the best. In an interview to Hauterfly, Esha said, “He didn’t want that I should enter the movies. He is a bit orthodox, rightfully so. He is a Punjabi father, and he wanted that we should get married, settle down at 18.” She added, “There was a phase where I would lie to go out on late nights.”\n\nSpeaking frankly about her teens and her equation with father, Esha further said, “That is his conditioning, he is coming from a place where all the women in his house were brought up that way. But my upbringing was very different.”\n\nThe two share a wonderful relationship. However, there were reports of a rift when Esha and Hema Malini were missing from Sunny Deol's son Karan Deol's wedding. In an Instagram post, Dharmendra apologised in a cryptic note.\n\nHowever, soon after, Sunny, Eha and Bobby Deol were spotted together for Gadar 2 screening. All's well that ends well.\n\nFor more such stories on celebs and relationships, follow us on Indiatimes Lifestyle.",

Thoda mahaul banana padega. Thoda dum lagana padega bhai.\" (Taking it lightly won't work, Wasu. We need to create some atmosphere.

		"title": "Rishabh Pant’s journey from near-death to cricketing glory is the comeback of the century",
		"text": "Rishabh Pant is no stranger to the spotlight, but his latest chapter is nothing short of a blockbuster comeback. Two years after a horrific car accident nearly ended his life, the 27-year-old wicketkeeper-batter is back with a vengeance. Pant’s return to the cricketing stage in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy opener against Australia has fans, experts, and even rivals buzzing.\n\nRishabh Pant’s comeback after accident\n\nIn December 2022, Pant faced what can only be described as a nightmare. His car crashed into a divider near Roorkee, flipped over, and burst into flames. Pant managed to escape, suffering severe injuries, including multiple ligament tears and burns. If that wasn’t horrifying enough, the star batter had to push his dislocated leg back into place before getting medical help. Yes, you read that right—he straightened his leg, action-hero style.\n\nFast forward to now, and Pant is not just walking; he’s smashing sixes and making waves in Perth. His 37-run knock in India’s first innings may not seem colossal, but considering the journey he’s been on, it’s monumental. With his trademark resilience, Pant has proven that no obstacle—be it fiery bowlers or fiery accidents—can keep him down.\n\nRavi Shastri reacts on Rishabh Pant’s comeback\n\nCricket legend Ravi Shastri, speaking to Fox Cricket, aptly called Pant’s return a “miracle.” He recalled visiting Pant post-accident and being stunned by the extent of his injuries. “Seeing him stand, let alone play cricket, is miraculous,” Shastri said, lauding Pant’s mental fortitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the Test series, Pant already teased his return during IPL 2024 and India’s victorious T20 World Cup campaign. But his performance in red-ball cricket proves that the fighter in him is far from done. With a solid average of 46.66 in five matches post-recovery, Pant continues to silence doubters.\n\nReflecting on his journey, Pant shared that the accident changed his perspective on life. Gratitude, humility, and hunger are now his guiding principles. His positive outlook resonates as much as his fearless cricketing style.\n\nRishabh Pant for test match in Perth\n\nDay 1 in Perth saw Pant hold his own against a fiery Australian attack, as India’s top order crumbled. While Hazlewood wreaked havoc, Bumrah and Siraj staged a spirited comeback with the ball, setting up an exciting match.\n\nPant’s miraculous journey from a hospital bed to the hallowed pitch of Perth isn’t just a comeback; it’s a masterclass in resilience. Whether it’s facing fast bowlers or life’s toughest blows, Rishabh Pant always plays to win.",

		"text": "The Mahayuti alliance—a coalition of the BJP, Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's faction of the Nationalist Congress Party—is taking a commanding lead in 217 constituencies, according to early trends in the 288-seat Maharashtra Assembly election 2024. As the alliance inches toward a potential clean sweep, social media is filled with \"resort owner\" memes. Wondering what resorts have to do with Maharashtra politics? Let's break it down.\n\nThe \"resort owner\" memes draw inspiration from a recurring theme in Indian politics—where elected representatives are often \"secured\" in resorts to prevent defection or poaching by rival parties.\n\nThis tactic usually surfaces in scenarios where no single party secures a clear majority, raising the stakes for coalition-building.\n\nTo protect their flock, political parties sometimes take off their winning candidates to secretive locations, typically luxury resorts on the city outskirts or even in another state, keeping them away from potential persuasion by opponents.\n\nFor instance, in June 2022, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, along with rebel Shiv Sena MLAs, camped at a high-end hotel in Guwahati for eight days.\n\nThis move was a key part of the political maneuvering that ultimately led to the downfall of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra.\n\nIt's moments like these that make \"resort politics\" a quintessential part of India's electoral drama—and the perfect fodder for internet humour.\n\nCheck out some of the memes and posts here:\n\nResort owners after watching maharashtra election results. pic.twitter.com/vm6dlWIwIV — Sai Teja (@csaitheja) November 23, 2024\n\nResort owners watching Election Results pic.twitter.com/uNvpjpHC8p — Sagar (@sagarcasm) November 23, 2024\n\nWho are the Real Losers of #MaharashtraAssemblyElections2024 ??\n\n\n\nRESORT OWNERS !! 😭 😭 😭 — LuckyGoHappy (@shrisha_uchil) November 23, 2024\n\n#ElectionResults Resort owners in Karnataka hoping the Election trends to change in Maharastra pic.twitter.com/7p3Z3ujBCS — Paid News (@Wheelerdeealer) November 23, 2024\n\nMaharashtra Assembly Election Results 2024: Who's winning?\n\nEarly trends indicate a sweeping victory for the Mahayuti alliance in the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections.\n\nAs per the initial results, the BJP is ahead in 128 seats, the Shiv Sena in 55, and the NCP in 35 constituencies.\n\nThe RYSWP is leading in one seat, reinforcing the alliance's dominance in the 288-seat assembly.\n\nWith these trends, the Mahayuti appears poised for a landslide victory, much to the disappointment of resort owners.\n\nTo stay updated on the stories that are going viral, follow Indiatimes Trending.",

However, only seven of them survived the harsh blizzard conditions, where temperatures had dropped to -33 degrees Celsius. The frozen bodies of the Patel family were later discovered by Canadian authorities on their side of the border.\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nHuman trafficking network member speaks up\n\nProsecutors also produced an Indian-origin man, Rajinder Singh, who testified that he had made over $400,000 smuggling more than 500 people through the same network that included Patel and Shand.

He said the migrants would often pay smugglers about $100,000 to get them from India to the US.\n\nAlso read: Indian Woman Arrested At US-Canada Border May Need Partial Hand Amputation Due To Frostbite\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nThe death of the Patel family sent shockwaves across the US, Canada, and India.

For two to three years during the pandemic, the hirings had almost come to a standstill. It was natural that it increased once the companies settled down once the pandemic was over.\"\n\nThis year, nearly 2,400 students have signed up for campus placements, with the total number of applicants rising by more than 50% in recent years, according to faculty members.\n\nPhase I of the interviews is set to begin on December 1 at top IITs.\n\nFor more information on exams, results and careers, please visit Indiatimes Education.",

While some felt that Gupta was unfairly criticised for his past failures, others said, \"Our apology to him should be as loud as our disrespect was.\"\n\nFor more news and current affairs from around the world, please visit Indiatimes News.",

		"text": "This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.\n\n\n\nYou will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.\n\n\n\nYou will become ready to continue learning advanced front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.\n\n\n\nYou will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.\n\n\n\nAnd unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!\n\n\n\nBut... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's \"The Complete JavaScript Course\". In fact, it's like many courses in one! But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.",

The Samajwadi Party, despite gains in the general election, struggled to maintain momentum, securing only two seats. The BJP's victory in Kundarki, a Muslim-majority constituency, underscores its expanding voter base.\n\nMaharashtra mandate is nod to “stay united to stay safe”, Opposition dividing OBC, SC, ST unity: PM Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the BJP-led Mahayuti's victory in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, attributing it to the unity of OBC, SC, and ST communities against divisive forces. He emphasized that the win reflects a mandate for development, good governance, and social justice, while rejecting falsehoods and ulterior motives.\n\nMaha Results: PM Modi's 'parasite' attack on Congress, targets Gandhis over 'Waqf Board appeasement' Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the latest round of elections had endorsed the message of development and defeated the politics of lies and betrayal propounded by the Congress and its allies. Addressing a gathering at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters here, Modi said divisive forces, negative politics and dynasticism have been defeated in the Maharashtra election and by-polls in various states. PM Modi accused Congress of \"appeasement politics\" and said it framed law concerning the Waqf Board, which has no mandate in the Constitution. He accused Congress of sowing seeds of \"appeasement\".\n\nNDA sweeps bypolls to four assembly segments in Bihar The ruling NDA secured victory in all four Bihar assembly bypolls, signaling a potential shift in the political landscape ahead of the 2025 elections. The BJP's strong performance, coupled with the JD(U)'s success, suggests a consolidation of NDA support. Meanwhile, the RJD faced setbacks, losing its position as the single largest party.\n\nNarendra Modi bears the hallmark of popular mandate: Sarbananda Sonowal Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal attributed the BJP-led NDA's success in the Maharashtra and Assam elections to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's effective governance. Sonowal emphasized that the newly elected candidates are committed to continuing the development agenda in their constituencies. He highlighted the positive impact of Modi's leadership on India's growth and the Northeast region's progress.\n\nBypolls: Ruling parties hold sway in states; BJP gains in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan; TMC reigns in West Bengal Ruling parties emerged victorious in most of the 13 states' assembly byelections. The BJP and its allies secured significant wins in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan. The Trinamool Congress swept West Bengal, while Congress faced setbacks. Priyanka Gandhi secured a landslide victory in the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll.\n\nUP bypolls: Yogi Adityanath asserts authority with 7-2 victory; 'batenge to katenge\" to remain central theme The BJP's victory in seven out of nine Uttar Pradesh assembly bypolls signals a resurgence for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Adityanath's emphasis on Hindu unity and the BJP's focus on nationalism proved successful, even in traditionally challenging seats. Despite the setback, the Samajwadi Party remains the primary opposition force in the state.\n\nNo power in the world can bring back Article 370: PM Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed BJP workers in Delhi after the party's victory in the Maharashtra elections. He emphasized that no force in the world could restore Article 370, asserting that only Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution is acceptable to the people. Modi also highlighted the success of the \"Ek hain toh safe hain\" sentiment, which, he said, taught a lesson to those who sow division based on caste, religion, language, and region.\n\nJP Nadda hails historic performance of NDA in Maharashtra Assembly, Bypolls; attacks Opposition over 'dividing' ideology BJP President JP Nadda celebrated the NDA's victory in the recent assembly and bypolls, attributing it to PM Modi's public service and global influence. He criticized the INDIA bloc and Uddhav Thackeray, stating that the election results demonstrated public rejection of their attempts to divide society and validated Modi's message of progress.",

		"text": "Equity mutual funds are the best investment option to achieve your long-term financial goals. Countless studies have proven that stocks have the potential to offer superior returns than other asset classes over a long period. So, if you have a long-term financial goal that is at least five to seven years away, you should consider investing in equity mutual fund schemes.However, it is equally important to choose the right equity mutual fund scheme. Your choice of mutual fund scheme should match your goals, investment horizon and risk profile. For example, if you are a conservative equity investor investing for a five-year goal, you may consider investing in largecap mutual fund schemes.If the investor wants to create the corpus without much volatility, he may also consider investing in aggressive hybrid schemes. Aggressive hybrid schemes invest in a mixed portfolio of equity (65-80 per cent) and debt (20-35 per cent). The debt part of the scheme offers stability to the portfolio during volatile times.Investors with moderate risk profile can consider investing in multicap schemes that invest across market capitalisations. These schemes are riskier than largecap schemes but have the potential to offer superior returns.Aggressive investors with a high risk tolerance and longer investment horizon can consider investing in midcap and smallcap schemes . These schemes invest in mid-sized and small-sized companies and can turn highly volatile during a bad phase in the market. However, these companies can grow into large companies and reward investors with extra returns for the extra risk they are taking.Sector schemes or thematic schemes are meant for sophisticated or high networth investors. These schemes can help investors to take exposure to a sector or theme that they want to bet. However, mutual fund advisors believe that investors should invest in these schemes only if they can time their entry and exit in these schemes and have intimate knowledge about the sector.High net worth investors can also look at international schemes to diversify their portfolio across geographies. However, mutual fund advisors believe that small investors should give these schemes a miss as it would dilute total returns from their portfolio.",

Alternatively, you can enter a date of your choice in the ‘Current Age or Age as of ’ field to know your age at that particular point in time.Additionally, this calculator can be used to determine the age of things such as a historical monument or a vintage/collectable item. For such calculations, enter the date on which the construction of the monument was completed or when the collectable item was procured in the ‘Date of Birth’ field and the present date in the ‘Current Age or Age as of’ field to calculate the age of the monument or the item.The calculator displays the age in terms of years, months and days. It also has a ‘Singular Expression’ section where the calculation is shown in months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.An age calculator is a digital tool that can be used to calculate the age of a person, place or thing, based on the information provided in the calculator.By default, the calculator shows the present date in both the ‘Date of Birth’ and the ‘Current Age or Age as of’ field.To calculate your current age or that of an object/thing, fill the ‘Date of Birth’ field with relevant details and leave the ‘Current Age or Age as of’ field as it is. On the other hand, to know how old you were or would be at a certain point in time, fill the ‘Date of Birth’ field with relevant details and enter the required date in the ‘Current Age or Age as of’ field. This process can also be followed to determine the age of a place or thing as of a certain date.Here is a list of the steps that need to be followed to operate this calculator:India, as a country, is an amalgamation of cultures where various types of traditional calendars are followed. Prominent among them include the Saka Samvat, Vikram Samvat, and the Hijri calendar. But, when it comes to official purposes, the Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in India as well as various countries around the world.This calculator also uses the Gregorian calendar to make calculations. A year is divided into 365 days in this calendar, except for a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year is categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year.The system used by this calculator is the most commonly used age system. In this calculator, a person’s age starts from zero and the person turns one year old only after 12 months have passed. Similarly, in any type of age calculation here, the age is increased by one year after the completion of 12 months from the birth date/start date.Though the time zone doesn’t play a significant role in age calculation, this calculator can detect the user's time zone and display the required age accordingly.",

The value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ have been provided for both the time-values. In case, a value field is left blank, the result would be displayed accordingly.This time calculator allows users to either add or subtract a time value from a ‘Start Time’, where the ‘Start Time’ is represented by a particular date along with a certain time on that date. The ‘Start Time’ comprises a date -- which can either be filled directly into the relevant value fields or entered using the calendar -- and a time value which has the value fields ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’, ‘Second’ and a drop-down menu to toggle between AM and PM. The time-value to be subtracted from the ‘Start Time’ consists of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’.Here, users can add and subtract a string of time-values using a mathematical expression. Value fields included in an expression are ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ denoted by the letters ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘m’ and ‘s’ respectively.The calculator can be used to determine the difference between two time-values.The calculator has two fields -- ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’. Both the fields have options to enter the required number of hours, minutes and seconds and to choose between ‘AM’ and ‘PM’. Enter the required details in both the fields and click on the ‘CALCULATE’ button to know the difference between both the time values.The output displayed is either in terms of hours, minutes and seconds or only in hours or minutes or seconds.If the time-value provided in the ‘Start Time’ field is ahead of that provided in the ‘End Time’ field, then the calculator automatically assumes the ‘Start Date’ to be on the previous day.The input provided in the hours, minutes and seconds sections of the ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ fields need to be valid values. The value provided in the ‘hours’ section should be less than 24, that in the ‘minutes’ section has to be less than 60 and the input in the ‘seconds’ section should also be less than 60.The calculator finds the time difference between a certain time on a start date and a certain time on the end date.The calculator has a ‘Start Time’ and an ‘End Time’ field. Both the fields allow users to enter the start date or end date by either choosing the required date from a calendar or by entering the month, date and year in their respective sections. Additionally, users can also enter a certain time value by entering required details in the ‘hour’, ‘minute’ and ‘second’ sections and choosing between ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ in the ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ fields or by clicking on the ‘now’ button to select the current time.Enter the relevant details in the input fields and click on the ‘CALCULATE’ button to determine the time gap between two dates. The input provided in the ‘Start Time’ field should be earlier than that in the ‘End Time’ field.The output shown is either in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds or only in terms of days or hours or minutes and seconds.A time calculator is an algorithmic digital tool that can be used to add/subtract various time-values and make different types of time calculations such as finding the time difference between two important events, determining the date 3 years before today, knowing how many hours, minutes or seconds are there in a year, etc.Time, as we know it, can range from several years to a few seconds. So, while making calculations using the above calculators, it’s important to know some basic units of time and the calendar system used for designing these calculators.Here is a list of some basic units of time:The calendar used:These calculators use the Georgian calendar to make calculations. In this calendar, a year is divided into 365 days, with the exception of a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year are categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except the month of February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year.The first calculator basically lets users determine the sum or the difference between two time-values. Here, time values are represented in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.The input section of the calculator has two rows consisting of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ in each row and two buttons to select either ‘Add+’ or ‘Subtract-’ placed in between those two rows. Similarly, the output section has a row consisting of all the value fields that are present in the input rows.The input provided can either be in whole numbers or decimal, but they should be positive rational numbers. The value entered in the first row of the input section can either be greater or smaller than the value entered in the second row. Additionally, if need be, users can choose to leave any of the value fields or multiple value fields in the input section blank.The output displayed is either a positive or a negative value based on the input provided and the function (+ or -) chosen. The output time value also consists of the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’. Additionally, this calculator also displays the result in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds individually.The second calculator can either add a time value to or subtract a time value from a particular date and a certain time on that date.Here, the upper part of the input section is called ‘Start Time’. The ‘Start Time’ consists of two sub-sections. One where the date is to be filled and another where the time. By default, the ‘Start Time’ initially shows the current date and time. The date can either be filled by filling up all the required sections i.e. month, date and year individually or by clicking on the calendar button. The input for the time part can be provided by entering relevant values in the ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ sections and choosing either ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ from the drop-down menu beside it.The lower part of this calculator has the value fields ‘Day’, ‘Hour’, ‘Minute’ and ‘Second’ to provide input for the time-value that is to be added or subtracted from the concerned date and time. Users can choose either to add or subtract the time-values from the middle section by clicking either on the ‘Add+’ or the ‘Subtract-’ button.The result displayed is a date and a time on that date which is either before or after the date in the ‘Start Time’ field depending on the function (add or subtract) chosen.In the third calculator, time-values based calculations can be carried out using mathematical expressions. The mathematical expressions used in this calculator are made up of days, hours, minutes and seconds which are denoted by the letters ‘d’, ‘h’, ‘m’ and ‘s’ respectively.Just like the previous calculators, this calculator can also only perform addition and subtraction of time-values. The time-values provided as input to this calculator should be a number accompanied by the letter which represents its unit.For example: 3d 4h 5m 6s, 8h 25m, 1d 0h 0m 3s, 3600s, etc.The output displayed is in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds. The result is also shown individually in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.",

		"text": "Proper Fractions: In this kind of fraction, the value of the numerator is lower than that of the denominator. Fractions such as 3/7, 2/9, etc. can be termed as proper fractions. Improper Fractions: For these fractions, the value of the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator. For example, 9/5, 12/12, 267/23, etc. are all improper fractions. Mixed Fractions: These fractions are basically another way of representing improper fractions. They can also be called a simplified version of improper fractions. For example, the improper fraction 19/4 can be represented as the mixed fraction 4 ¾.\n\nThe calculators can be used to add, subtract, multiply or divide fractions. Additionally, there are also tools that can be used to simplify fractions or convert decimal numbers into fractions and vice versa.This calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of proper and improper fractions.

The input provided in any of the fields can either be a positive or a negative number.This calculator can be used for calculations involving fractions with very large integers.Fractions are used to represent some part of a whole thing. Fractions are usually in the format a/b. Here, the number that is before the slash is called the numerator and the number that is after the slash is called the denominator. The denominator represents the whole thing and the numerator represents the number of equal parts of the whole thing.For Example: Suppose, the whole thing is a tray of eggs with 12 eggs in it. When the tray is full, it can be represented by the fraction 12/12. Now, if you take out 5 eggs from the tray then the portion taken out would be represented by the fraction 5/12. Whereas, the portion remaining in the tray would be represented by the fraction 7/12.In general, there are three types of fractions which are mentioned below:Fractions can either be positive or negative numbers.

This has resulted in Indians following various types of calendars for religious, cultural and official purposes. Though there are numerous, some of the most common types of calendars used in India include the Saka Samvat Vikram Samvat , the Hijri calendar and the Georgian calendar The Saka Samvat lunisolar Hindu calendar is believed to have been introduced by the rulers of the Satavahana dynasty. Quite similar to those used for official purposes, this calendar also has 365 days and 12 months, and in 1957, it was adopted as the ' Indian National Calendar '. However, unlike the official new year's eve, according to the system followed by the Saka Samvat calendar, a new year begins with the onset of the 'Chaitra' month whose first day coincides with March 22 in a conventional calendar or with March 21 if its a leap year.Similarly, there are some unconventional factors that accompany the Vikram Samvat and the Hijri calendar as well. The Vikram Samvat is a Hindu lunar calendar that is based on the movement of the moon. It has 354 days and 12 months in a year. The months in this calendar are further divided into two phases: 'Shukla Paksha' which begins with a new moon and ' Krishna Paksha ' which starts with a full moon. The Hijri calendar is a lunar Islamic calendar that also has 354 days. Followed worldwide, this calendar is used to determine the dates for various Islamic rituals including Ramadan and Hajj.An improvised version of the Julian calendar , the Georgian calendar is used in India as well as various other countries around the world for official purposes. In this calendar, a year is divided into 365 days, with the exception of a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year are categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except the month of February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year.",

		"text": "Ladki Bahna Yojana—A Game Changer\n\nThe Maharashtra government's Ladki Bahna Yojana emerged as a cornerstone of its electoral success, securing widespread support from women voters across the state. The scheme, designed to provide financial aid to women, struck a chord across diverse demographics.\n\nHailing the scheme, Ajit Pawar said,“Ladki Bahin Yojana became our game changer. It defeated each of our adversaries. I have not seen such a victory in my memory. We will not be swayed away by the victory but this has increased our responsibility for sure. We have to behave responsibly now. Especially financial discipline is needed to fulfil all our promises. We are committed to that.\"\n\nLaunched on Raksha Bandhan (August 2024), the Ladki Bahin scheme offers ₹1,500 monthly to over one crore women in Maharashtra. Modeled after the 'Ladli Behna Yojana' by Shivraj Chouhan's Madhya Pradesh government, the Maharashtra government has pledged that the scheme will continue indefinitely.In an early trial run, more than 30 lakh eligible women received ₹3,000 directly into their bank accounts.\n\nDespite an estimated annual expenditure of ₹46,000 crore, the Ladki Bahna Yojana proved instrumental in winning the trust and loyalty of women voters, significantly influencing the election outcome.\n\nThe Role of RSS\n\nThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) played a pivotal role in empowering the BJP's electoral campaign, particularly in Haryana , where its cadre worked tirelessly to reach the grassroots. Their efforts ensured BJP's resonance among Hindu, non-Jat, and Dalit communities, giving the party a crucial edge.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the RSS adopted a similarly aggressive approach. After the BJP's underwhelming performance in the Lok Sabha elections in northern states, the Sangh redoubled its efforts to support the BJP's campaign. Reports, including one from The Indian Express, highlighted the RSS’s systematic door-to-door outreach, urging voters to back the Mahayuti alliance.\n\nSenior RSS officials credited the Sajag Raho campaign—a personalized voter engagement initiative—as a key factor in bridging caste divides and rallying Hindu voters under a united front.\n\nThe RSS’s active participation extended to other states, notably in Uttar Pradesh by-polls, where it played a decisive role in aiding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 's campaign. The Sangh even endorsed Adityanath’s slogan, \"Batenge toh katenge\", underlining its steadfast commitment to promoting Hindu solidarity.\n\nHindutva in Focus\n\nBoth the Maharashtra and Haryana elections witnessed a sharp focus on Hindutva as BJP leaders doubled down on polarizing narratives. Slogans like \"Batenge toh katenge\" and its toned-down counterpart, \"Ek hai toh safe hai\", struck a powerful chord with the BJP’s core supporters. These hardline messages effectively countered opposition efforts to consolidate votes from Muslim, Dalit, and Kunbi communities, solidifying BJP’s dominance in both states.\n\nStrategic OBC Outreach\n\nOBCs, comprising nearly 38% of Maharashtra's population, hold influence in around 175 of the 288 assembly seats. Recognizing this, BJP leaders, including Devendra Fadnavis, crafted a focused outreach strategy targeting this demographic. The party employed the \"MaDhVa\" formula—representing Mali (gardener), Dhangar (shepherd), and Vanjari communities—to strengthen its appeal, particularly following the divisive Maratha reservation agitation.\n\nCurrent trends indicate that this approach has paid off, with the BJP projected to win 17 seats in the Marathwada region alone.\n\nMahayuti Decimates MVA\n\nAfter defeating MVA, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said the results of the assembly elections were historic, and decided to whom the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena belong to.\n\nHolding a joint press conference as the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP coalition was poised to win a massive victory, the leaders of the Mahayuti assured that the next government will be formed smoothly.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the people rejected the politics of appeasement and responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's `Ek Hai toh Safe Hai' message of unity.\n\nNCP chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar averred that the ruling alliance will not get carried away by the landslide win, and will bring financial discipline.\n\nReferring to the poor showing of the rival factions, both Shinde and Ajit Pawar said the results showed to whom the Shiv Sena and NCP belong.\n\n\"After all the results are declared, our MLAs will come to Mumbai, and all three parties will elect their leaders,\" Fadnavis said.\n\nShinde pointed out that the three parties had finalised their seat-sharing amicably, and said the government formation process would not face any hinderance.\n\nThey learnt lessons from the Lok Sabha debacle and took corrective steps, Ajit Pawar added.",

		"title": "Explained: How RSS-BJP Weaved Magic In Maharashtra",
		"text": "It is 3:30 PM right now and the results of Maharashtra Assembly Elections are clear. BJP+ has won by a landslide. As of now, BJP is leading in 132 seats, and its alliance partner Shiv Sena is leading in 54 seats. The total number of seats in Maharashtra Assembly elections is 288.\n\nThis is, by any measure, a landslide victory. This victory is even more significant because just a few months ago, during the 2024 Lok Sabha election, BJP performed rather poorly in Maharashtra. BJP and its alliance partners secured just 17 seats in the state, whereas Congress and its alliance partners secured 30 seats. BJP, on its own, won just 9 seats. BJP's surprising underperformance in Maharashtra and U.P. were the two main factors due to which BJP lost its majority.\n\nSo, in a few months, what changed?\n\nSimply put, the role played by RSS. In the Maharashtra Assembly elections, RSS played a crucial role in helping BJP+ win. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, RSS, largely, remained inactive. Why? It is hard to say, there is a lot of speculation. Although, one can safely assume that the BJP President's statement, in which he suggested BJP is self-sufficient now and doesn't need the Sangh's help, didn't go down well with numerous Swayamsevaks.\n\nBJP, after the surprising result of 2024 Lok Sabha elections, decided to course correct and reached out to the Sangh, which, after all, is BJP's ideological parent. Multiple reports state that Devendra Fadnavis, who himself is a Swayamsevak, reached out to the Sangh, along with other senior BJP leaders. Reports state that just weeks after the Lok Sabha elections, Fadnavis, along with other BJP leaders, met senior leaders of the Sangh at least 6 times, to create a plan for the assembly election.\n\nA RSS functionary who was reportedly present in one of the meetings, said to a leading Indian daily that \"We consider the Lok Sabha result a lesson for the BJP. The Nadda statement also hurt us and led to the Sangh keeping away from the elections. However the BJP and the Sangh have no options besides each other, yes we were upset but when your own makes a mistake you slap them once and work with them again.”\n\nOne factor that may have persuaded Sangh to play a role in this elections, is the Congress' attempt to increase the salience of caste amongst Hindus. RSS, since the time of its founding by K.B. Hedgewar, has considered caste based hierarchies immoral. RSS has, for decades, advocated that Dalits should become temple priests. In 2006, Pancajanya, Sangh's newspaper, stated in an editorial that “even God will desert the temple where Dalits can't enter”.\n\nAs India is urbanizing, the salience of caste is getting diluted and national identity, Hindu identity, is becoming more prominent. Sangh views this as a good trend. Congress' attempt to revive caste identity is a cause of concern amongst many Swayamsevaks. Some reports suggest that RSS felt compelled to take part in this election, because, Congress' attempt to resuscitate the cadaver of caste, alarmed them (the Sangh).\n\nA look at how RSS reached out to voters\n\nThe collaboration between the two organizations (Sangh and BJP) played a pivotal role in reversing the BJP’s fortunes, with the saffron party securing a decisive win in the state.\n\nStrategic Deployment and Grassroots Mobilization\n\nFacing challenges in several key constituencies, the RSS deployed its cadre to regions where the BJP was on the back foot. According to a BJP insider cited in an Indian daily, a mechanism was established for sharing inputs and implementing course-corrective measures based on RSS feedback.\n\nThe RSS’s strategy avoided high-profile public rallies or overt endorsements of BJP candidates. Instead, its Swayamsevaks focused on raising awareness about issues perceived as threats to Hindu unity. “The RSS in its characteristic style has activated its network to create awareness on crucial issues threatening the unity of Hindus. Our goal is to build a strong Hindu Rashtra that caters to the welfare of every individual, rising above caste, community, and religion,” said an RSS leader, to an Indian newspaper.\n\nE pluribus unum?\n\nThis emphasis on Hindu unity was evident in BJP’s campaign messaging. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan, “Ek hai toh safe hai” (Together, we are safe), was tailored to drill into the head of voters that caste divisions must be rejected. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath echoed the sentiment with his warning, “Batenge toh katenge”, urging voters to reject divisions along caste lines.\n\nCountering Opposition Consolidation\n\nThe BJP faced significant challenges from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which had gained traction among Dalits and Muslims after its “Save the Constitution” campaign during the Lok Sabha polls. Additionally, Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil’s demands for community reservations further tested the ruling Mahayuti alliance.\n\nAn RSS leader highlighted the perceived dangers of caste and religious consolidation by opposition forces, stating to an Indian daily, “In the Lok Sabha polls, we saw how dangerously the consolidation of caste and religion took place, which was detrimental to society at large. Our role is to impress upon people the dangers of such divisions and to unite Hindus to defeat such designs.”\n\nVictory through Cohesion\n\nThe synergy between the RSS’s grassroots efforts and the BJP’s campaign strategy ultimately paid dividends. By emphasizing unity and addressing the concerns of various communities, the BJP was able to consolidate its support base. The result was a clear majority for the saffron alliance in Maharashtra, a much-needed victory after the Lok Sabha disappointment.",

		"text": "Maharashtra Election Results: The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance in Maharashtra has staged a resounding comeback, with the latest trends from the Election Commission showing it leading in 217 of the state’s 288 assembly seats. Mahayuti is all likely to retain power in the state, leaving the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) trailing far behind.\n\nThe victory marks a dramatic turnaround for the Mahayuti alliance, which only five months ago had faced a disappointing Lok Sabha election outcome, securing just 17 of the state’s 48 seats.\n\nThis time, the alliance deployed an aggressive campaign centered on welfare measures that appear to have resonated with voters, particularly women.\n\nLadki Behna Yojana: The Game-Changer?\n\nThe most important among the welfare schemes that have driven Mahayuti’s resurgence is the “Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana.”\n\nLaunched in June, the scheme aims to empower women economically by providing direct cash transfers of ₹1,500 per month to eligible women aged 21 to 65 years. The scheme covers married, widowed, divorced, abandoned, and destitute women from families earning less than ₹2.5 lakh annually, and even extends to one unmarried woman per household.\n\nThe Mahayuti alliance also promised to increase the monthly aid to ₹2,100 upon returning to office.\n\nThis promise, along with other schemes like free LPG cylinders and the Ladka Bhau Yojana, created a robust welfare narrative that seems to have secured the alliance a critical support base.\n\nPeople Have Responded to Our Work: CM Shinde\n\nChief Minister Eknath Shinde credited the election outcome to the welfare measures bought by his government. “I thank all my ladki bahins (dear sisters) and brothers in the state who voted in large numbers for us,” Shinde said while addressing reporters.\n\n“The voting trend is an endorsement of our work. Every section of society, particularly women, has responded positively to our efforts for development and welfare.”\n\n“This outcome increases our responsibility to serve the people better. The Ladki Bahin Yojana has shown that targeted welfare can make a real difference,” he added.\n\nMVA's Struggles to Counter Welfare Narrative",

		"title": "Eknath Shinde: The New Face of Maratha Politics, Displacing Sharad Pawar’s Legacy",
		"text": "In a historic political shift, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has emerged as the dominant force in Maratha politics, replacing the towering figure of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar . Shinde’s meteoric rise has been cemented by his party Shiv Sena’s remarkable performance in the recently concluded Maharashtra assembly elections, where his leadership and grassroots clout reshaped the political landscape.\n\nShinde’s emphatic win from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane was symbolic of his growing influence. Securing 1,59,060 votes and a commanding 78.4% vote share, he defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Kedar Dighe, nephew of his mentor Anand Dighe, by a margin of 1.2 lakh votes. This victory not only underscored Shinde’s dominance on his home turf but also marked a new chapter in Maharashtra’s political dynamics.\n\nPawar's influence declining?\n\nIn a state long dominated by the towering figure of Sharad Pawar, who held sway over the Maratha vote bank for decades, Shinde’s rise signals a generational shift. Pawar, known for his strategic acumen and ability to build coalitions, has seen his influence wane in recent years. The NCP’s performance in this election, where it struggled to retain its foothold, highlights the changing tide.\n\nShinde's rise to power\n\nShinde’s journey to power has been nothing short of dramatic. In 2022, he led a rebellion against then-Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, splitting the Shiv Sena—a party founded by Bal Thackeray—and aligning with the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) to form the government. The move triggered a bitter feud between the two factions, with Shinde’s camp eventually securing the Shiv Sena’s name and iconic ‘bow-and-arrow’ symbol.\n\nUnder Shinde’s leadership, the Shiv Sena achieved a spectacular electoral performance. The party won 57 seats, out of the 81 candidates it fielded. Meanwhile, the rival Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Uddhav Thackeray, managed just nine wins and was leading in 11 seats.\n\nHere is what you need to know\n\nThe BJP, Shinde’s ally in the Mahayuti coalition, emerged as the largest party with 133 seats, while the coalition as a whole secured a staggering 233 seats in the 288-member assembly. Shinde’s ability to secure significant representation for his faction within the alliance underscores his growing importance in state and coalition politics.\n\nPolitical analysts believe Shinde’s success lies in his appeal to the Maratha community, a politically influential group in Maharashtra. While Sharad Pawar once dominated this space, Shinde has capitalized on the changing aspirations of the electorate, blending his Maratha identity with the larger Hindu identity, to which Shinde is ideologically committed.\n\nShinde’s victory and the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition’s triumph also signal a shift in Maharashtra’s political narrative, with the traditional power structures being redefined. For decades, Sharad Pawar’s strategic maneuvering made him the face of Maratha politics, but Shinde’s rise suggests that the mantle may now rest with a new leader.",

As per the latest data by the Election Commission, Hemant leads his home turf Barhait with a margin of over 26,000 votes, with BJP's Gamliyel Hembrom trailing.\n\nDefying the exit poll predictions, the JMM is on its way to form its government for the third consecutive term in the states after leading in nearly 50 seats, a little above the halfway mark. Meanwhile, this year's election will hold immense significance as for the first time in the state's political history a Chief Minister will be elected for the second consecutive time.\n\nThe EC's latest data as of 5:20 pm showed a JMM-led alliance Mahagathbandhan with 57 seats (JMM-34, Congress - 17, RJD- 4 and CPI (ML) (L) 2). While the BJP-led NDA is trailing on 24 seats only.\n\nHemant Soren's Triumph\n\nThe recent historic win of JMM appears to be a public response to the Enforcement Directorate's action against Hemant Soren. In 2019, the JMM won only 13 of 38 seats while the BJP bagged 12 and Congress 8.\n\nWorry mounted JMM after Soren had to resign as the CM of the state ahead of his arrest by the ED in a money laundering case in January this year. However, senior leader Champai Soren took the helm of the state. However, soon after being granted bail by the High Court, Hemant was sworn in as the CM for the third time.\n\nFollowing this, Champai Soren left the party which was eventually seen as a major poll plank by the BJP, with leaders highlighting how a tribal leader was insulted by the JMM.\n\nHemant Soren's Comeback\n\nIn the 2024 polls, the BJP held several big including Prime Minister Narendra Modi , and Amit Shah who highlighted \"illegal immigration\" from Bangladesh as the main factor in the state. Furthermore, the party said that Jharkhand's 'maati, beti and roti' (land, daughter and bread) were in peril because \"infiltrators\" were grabbing the jal, zameen and jungle from the tribals.",

		"text": "Election Results 2024: Assembly elections results in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Assam and West Bengal have been declared and once again its not a favourable outcome for the Congress party.\n\nThe Mahayuti's Tsunami in Maharashtra completely wiped out the Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance and restricted it to just 45 seats. While Maharashtra saw a complete rout of the MVA, Jharkhand has come out as a breather for the INDIA bloc particularly to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) but not so for the Congress.\n\nBuilding upon the momentum it gained in Lok Sabha polls, Congress under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, once again failed to impress the voters in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Assam and even Jharkhand.\n\nRahul Gandhi lead's Congress' catastrophe in elections, but how?\n\nMaharashtra results 2024\n\nCongress contested on a total of 101 seats in Maharashtra but managed to win just 15 seats. In 2019 elections, it won 44 seats. So from 44, the Congress came down to 15, given that they contested on more seats this time then the last election.\n\nJharkhand results 2024\n\nCongress contested on 30 seats and managed to win just 16. However, the INIDA bloc won the state with 56 seats comprising JMM, Congress, RJD and CPI (ML) (L). In 2019 also, the Congress won 16 seats only. So after 5 years, its growth remained stagnant.\n\nBypoll results\n\nThe Congress contested bypolls on 33 out of 48 seats but won only 7 of them. Out of these 7 seats, the Congress won 3 in Karnataka, two in Kerala – one each in Assembly and Parliamentary constituency, one each in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.\n\nOverall, the Congress party contested on a total of 164 seats but registered victory in just 38 of them. The only face-saver for the Congress is Karnataka, where it managed a 100 per cent strike rate. The Grand Old Party conducted 3 seats and won all of them.\n\nIn a slight comparison, since 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 549 seats went for elections out of which BJP won 231 while Congress just managed to win 75 of them.\n\nSo, for the Congress party winning just 38 out of the 164 seats is a performance which it seriously needs to introspect.\n\nRahul welomes Jharkhand results, calls Maharashtra unexpected\n\nRahul Gandhi said that the INDIA bloc's victory in the Jharkhand Assembly polls is a one for the protection of the Constitution as well as of water, forest and land, even as he described the Maharashtra poll results as \"unexpected\" and said his party will analyse the election outcome in the state in detail.\n\nIn a post in Hindi on X, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha thanked the voters of Jharkhand as well as those who voted for the INDIA opposition bloc in Maharashtra.\n\n\"Heartfelt thanks to the people of Jharkhand for giving a huge mandate to INDIA. Hearty congratulations and best wishes to Chief Minister Hemant Sorenji, all the workers of the Congress and the JMM for this victory.\n\n\"This victory of the alliance in the state is a victory for the protection of water, forest and land, along with that of the Constitution,\" he said.\n\n\"The results of Maharashtra are unexpected and we will analyse those in detail,\" Gandhi said as he thanked the voters of the state for their support and all the party workers for their hard work.\n\nThe former Congress chief also lauded Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her victory on her poll debut from Kerala's Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency and said she will transform Wayanad into a beacon of progress with her dedication.\n\n\"I feel immense pride as my family in Wayanad has placed its trust in Priyanka. I know she will lead with courage, compassion and unwavering dedication to transform our cherished Wayanad into a beacon of progress and prosperity,\" he said in another post on X.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi won the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll with a huge margin on Saturday. The seat was vacated by Rahul Gandhi after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from both Rae Bareli and Wayanad in the parliamentary polls held in April-May.",

The BJP won 6 seats while its ally RLD won the lone seat it contested.\n\nThe victory in UP bypolls has let the BJP to continue its strong hold in one of the most electorally important state in north India, which sends the maximum – 80 – MPs to the Parliament.

And on November 24, 2024, Maharashtra Election Results showed that he is back yet again.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared the clip and showered praise on Devendra Fadnavis for the resounding victory. “Devendra fadnavis said main samandar hu laut ke aaunga and today he will prove it. Very happy for this man. Those who deserve will get it\", said a social media user, terming his win a 'great comeback'.\n\nAnother wrote, “Devendra Fadnavis is back with a big bang! Mera Paani utarta dekh, mere kinare par ghar mat basa lena, Mai Samandar hoon laut kar wapis aaunga.”\n\n‘Victory of Unity’\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to reporters after the victory, Fadnavis called it the victory of unity. “The people of Maharashtra have given us an unprecedented victory. This shows that people are with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In line with the slogan he gave 'Ek hain toh safe hain', people from all sections and communities voted for us unitedly... This is the victory of Mahayuti, CM Eknath Shinde, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and Ramdas Athawale, this is the victory of unity”, said Fandvis.\n\nWhen asked who will be the next CM of Maharashtra, the Deputy CM said, \"There will be no dispute on the CM's face.

		"title": "Explained: Why Uddhav Thackeray Lost Ground in Maharashtra",
		"text": "Maharashtra Election Results 2024: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )-led Mahayuti alliance made a resounding comeback in Maharashtra , with trends showing its dominance in 236 of the state’s 288 assembly seats as of 6:57 PM, leaving the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) far behind.\n\nMaha Vikas Aghadi's looming defeat in Maharashtra is a crushing blow for Uddhav Thackeray. In just three years, the former Chief Minister has lost not only power but also his grip on the Shiv Sena and the legacy of his father, Balasaheb Thackeray. Eknath Shinde 's rebel faction, which accused Uddhav of abandoning his father’s principles for political gain, turned the election into a battle of \"Who is the real Shiv Sena?\" With the results in, Shinde’s camp is quick to declare this an ideological triumph. Let's have a look at 5 possible reasons why Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership faltered.\n\n1. Shift from Balasaheb’s Hindutva Ideology\n\nBalasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena was built on Hindutva and Marathi pride. Under Uddhav, however, the alliance with Congress and NCP alienated core supporters. This ideological drift allowed the BJP, under Devendra Fadnavis and Eknath Shinde, to consolidate the Hindutva voter base. Raj Thackeray ’s MNS also criticized Uddhav for straying from Balasaheb’s vision, weakening his credibility further.\n\nFor example, the BJP said that the party is determined to amend the Waqf Act, regardless of stiff political opposition. \"In Karnataka, an entire village received a notice from the Waqf board claiming ownership of land. Don't you all agree the Waqf Act should be amended,\" Union Home Minister Amit Shah asked the crowd at Hingoli. After a resounding ‘yes' from gathering, Shah said “No matter how much Uddhavji and Sharad Pawar oppose it, Modiji will amend Waqf Act.”\n\n2. Perception of Appeasement Politics\n\nUddhav’s alleged focus on Muslim appeasement created discontent among traditional Shiv Sena voters. Shinde leveraged this narrative, with welfare schemes like the Ladki Behna Yojana and strong Hindutva messaging. Amit Shah further attacked Uddhav over policies favoring Muslims, including alleged opposition to renaming Aurangabad and Osmanabad. Taking Uddhav head-on at Yavatmal, Amit Shah had said “Uddhav babu, on one hand you did not visit Ram temple in Ayodhya and on the other hand you agreed to give Rs 1,000 crore to build mosques. Chullu bhar paani mein doob maro, doob maro (you should die of shame). I want to say to Rahul Gandhi , Sharad Pawar and Uddhav, that no matter how hard you try, we won't allow reservations for Muslims in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maharashtra.”\n\nShah alleged state Congress president Nana Patole recently met Muslim leaders and agreed to their multiple demands in lieu of votes for MVA. Shah also lambasted Thackeray for his party's alleged opposition to renaming Aurangabad and Osmanabad, stating, \"The real Shiv Sena is with BJP now. Your party is only UBT Sena.\"\n\n3. 2020 Palghar Sadhus Lynching Case\n\nUddhav faced criticism for allegedly halting the probe into the 2020 Palghar Sadhus lynching case, under Congress pressure. This delay damaged his image as a Hindutva leader. Additionally, his opposition to Dharavi’s redevelopment, seen as anti-development by many, worked against him.\n\nShiv Sena secretary and spokesperson Kiran Pawaskar alleged that Uddhav Thackeray had asked all the party leaders to refrain from speaking on the matter as it is a \"sensitive issue\". \"In a meeting, Uddhav Thackeray said that this Palghar issue is very sensitive and no one (Ministers or leaders) would talk about this outside. The order was given to stay mum. What was the secret behind it? The secret was that Uddhav Thackeray received a call from Rahul Gandhi,\" said Pawaskar.\n\nThe probe was however later handed over to the CBI, Shiv Sena alleged that delay in handover damaged the probe. CM Eknath Shinde in January this year, handed over cheques of Rs 5 lakh each to kin of three persons. Shinde said his Shiv Sena has now given them assistance from its own funds. Attacking Thackeray, Shinde said that then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has never bothered to meet the kin of these three persons.\n\n4. Uddhav’s CEO-style Leadership\n\nUddhav’s CEO-style leadership alienated grassroots workers, as he was seen as unapproachable. Leaders like Eknath Shinde and BJP’s Fadnavis capitalized on this disconnect by maintaining strong voter outreach and organizational unity. Even Shiv Sena veterans criticized Uddhav’s lack of communication and decision-making.\n\nShiv Sena veteran and Lok Sabha MP Gajanan Kirtikar, charged Uddhav Thackeray with failing to grow the party organisation and being surrounded by a coterie. “Uddhav ji’s lack of communication and inability to handle any situation with due diligence has damaged the party badly. I have closely experienced this divergence in the styles of functioning of Balasaheb (late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray) and Uddhav ji. In Uddhav ji’s entire tenure, I have rarely sensed any streamlined [manner of] communication by him,” wrote Kirtikar in his recently-published memoirs Shiv Sena, Lokadhikar Aani Mee (The Shiv Sena, the Lokadhikar Samiti and I).\n\n5. Uddhav Thackeray's Opposing Dharavi Redevelopment\n\nUddhav Thackeray said his party would oppose transforming Mumbai into \"Adani City.\" He criticised Gautam Adani's award of the Dharavi redevelopment tender as potentially problematic and called for its cancellation.",

This cannot be the public's decision, even the public does not agree with these results. Once the results are out, we will talk more. In every election seat, money-counting machines were installed. Is it possible that Shinde gets 60 seats, Ajit Pawar gets 40 seats and BJP gets 125 seats? The people of this state are not dishonest. We have their faith on the people of Maharashtra.”",

I look forward to being your voice in Parliament! \"Thank you for giving me this honour and even more for the immense love you have given me,\" she said.\n\nIn her post, Priyanka also thanked her colleagues in the UDF, leaders from across Kerala, workers, volunteers and everyone else who supported her and worked \"incredibly hard\" in her poll campaign, by \"tolerating\" her \"12 hour a day (no food, no rest) car journeys, and for fighting like true soldiers for the ideals we all believe in\".",

At present, the seat is represented by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader and Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aaditya Thackeray. In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election, Aaditya Thackeray defeated Nationalist Congress Party’s Suresh Mane by a big margin of 67,427 votes. While Thackeray had secured 89,248 votes, Mane could bag only 21,821 votes in his favour.\n\nThe Worli Assembly constituency, located in the Mumbai City district and a part of the Mumbai South Lok Sabha constituency, is among the key constituencies in Maharashtra with high-profile electoral battles this year. In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly election, the Worli constituency is among those constituencies, which saw a fierce battle between Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Eknath Shinde -led Shiv Sena after their split.\n\nIn this year’s election, sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray is being challenged by Shiv Sena leader Milind Deora and Raj Thackeray -led MNS candidate Sandeep Deshpande.\n\nIn 2014, the then Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shinde had clinched the constituency with 60,625 votes, easily defeating NCP’s Sachin Ahir, who secured only 37,613 votes. Overall, Worli has remained a Shiv Sena stronghold. However, this time, the battle is expected to surprise the voters, as the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Shinde-led Shiv Sena are contesting against each other.\n\nWorli Election Result 2024: Here Are The Updates\n\n08:00 AM: Counting of votes begins\n\n06:00 AM: Counting of votes to begin at 8 AM amid tight security.\n\nWorli: Key Candidates\n\nIn the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly election, the Worli constituency will be a constituency to be focused upon as Shiv Sena (UBT) sitting MLA Aaditya Thackeray will take on Shinde-led Shiv Sena’s Milind Deora and MNS candidate Sandeep Deshpande. All eyes are on today’s results amid speculations of a close contest between Thackeray and Deora.\n\nExperts believe that Deora has an edge over Thackeray as the Shiv Sena leader is leveraging anti-incumbency and inaccessibility, and voters' frustration over several local issues.\n\nParty-Wise Candidate",

Axis My India had predicted that the Mahayuti would win somewhere between 178-200 seats in Maharashtra elections while in Jharkhand, the JMM-led alliance would repeat the government with JMM+ winning 53 seats and BJP getting restricted to 25. Axis My India's survey was the only one which bucked the trend as most exit polls predicted a victory for the NDA in Jharkhand also.\n\nSpeaking to Republic Media Network's Arnab Goswami, Pradeep Gupta said that face to face interviews with the representatives across the demography and geography of the states and doing analysis on whatever they said. We put our weight on different factors including socio economic and released numbers at the time of the exit poll.\n\nIn both Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections, there was a pro-incumbency. We couldn’t find much people saying that they were discontent or angry with the incumbent leadership, Pradeep Gupta said adding if a government repeats, it only happens on one factor which is delivery, delivery and delivery on the basis of various social welfare schemes, facilities given to farmers, etc.\n\nFocussing on Maharashtra, Pradeep Gupta said that the Dalits and Adivasis (tribals) who shifted to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Lok Sabha came back to support Mahayuti alliance in Assembly elections. He said that 10 per cent of the Dalits, 15 per cent of tribals returned from MVA to Mahayuti.\n\nIn Maharashtra's Vidarbha region which has a total of 62 seats, the Mahayuti won 50 of them. Pradeep Gupta also mentioned that women voted more for Mahayuti than the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).\n\nIn Mumbai, where the polling increased from 50 in 2019 to 55 per cent in 2024, increased the size of the Mahayuti’s victory as we predicted 200 odd seats but it went upto 230.",

		"text": "Kolkata: In a major triumph, the Trinamool Congress registered clean sweep in all six bypolls, while snatching Madarihat Assembly from BJP.\n\nThe latest results further cemented its political dominance in West Bengal, even as the ongoing protests over the RG Kar incident failed to sway voters.\n\nThe bypolls were held in six constituencies — Naihati, Haroa, Medinipur, Taldangra, Sitai (SC), and Madarihat (ST) — following the resignation of sitting MLAs who had vacated their assembly seats after securing victories in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nTMC Wins Bypolls Despite Facing Massive Protests Over RG Kar Issue\n\nThe elections held on November 13 were viewed as a key test for the ruling party in a politically tense environment, with protests surrounding the RG Kar issue escalating. Despite these protests, the TMC triumphed in all constituencies, extending its winning streak from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nFive of the six constituencies are in South Bengal, a TMC stronghold, while Madarihat, located in the northern part of the state, was previously won by the BJP in 2021. The by-poll results further solidify the TMC's political dominance throughout West Bengal.\n\nIn Haroa, where over 70 per cent of the electorate belongs to the minority community, the BJP came a distant third and failed to retain its deposit, prompting party leader Suvendu Adhikari to comment: “Minorities don’t vote for the BJP”.\n\nThe CPI(M)-led Left Front, which had hoped to capitalise on the RG Kar protests to revive its fortunes, faced a crushing defeat, losing its deposit in Sitai and Madarihat. Similarly, its ally, the CPI(ML), lost its deposit in Naihati, while the All India Secular Front (ISF) lost its deposit in Haroa.\n\nThe Congress, led by new state chief Suvankar Sarkar, contested without an alliance with the Left for the first time since 2021 but fared no better, losing deposits in all six constituencies.\n\nIn Sitai (SC), TMC’s Sangita Roy won by a margin of 1,30,636 over BJP’s Dipak Kumar Ray, who garnered only 35,348 votes. TMC’s vote share surged to 76 per cent, compared to 49 per cent in the 2021 state elections, while the BJP’s share plummeted from 45 per cent to just 16 per cent.\n\nBJP Loses Madarihat Seat To TMC\n\nThe Madarihat (ST) seat, previously held by the BJP, marked another significant victory for the TMC. The ruling party’s Jayprakash Toppo won with 79,186 votes, securing a lead of 28,168 votes over BJP’s Rahul Lohar.\n\nThis victory is historic for the TMC, as it marks the first time the party has taken control of Madarihat, a key seat in the tea garden belt, signaling a major political shift.\n\nThe TMC’s vote share surged to 54.05 per cent, while the BJP’s share dropped to 34 per cent, nearly mirroring TMC’s vote share of 34.13 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn Naihati, TMC’s Sanat Dey won with 78,772 votes, defeating BJP’s Rupak Mitra by 49,277 votes. TMC’s vote share increased to 62.97 per cent, up from 50 per cent in 2021, while BJP’s share fell to 23.58 per cent, a significant drop from 38 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn Haroa, TMC’s SK Rabiul Islam won with 1,57,072 votes, maintaining a commanding margin of 1,31,388 votes over Piyarul Islam of the ISF, who secured only 25,684 votes.\n\nThis result underscores TMC’s dominance among minorities in South Bengal. TMC's vote share surged to 76.63 per cent, while the ISF managed just 12.53 per cent, compared to 57.34 per cent for the TMC in 2021.\n\nIn Medinipur, TMC’s Sujoy Hazra won with 115,104 votes, a margin of 33,996 votes over BJP’s Subhajit Roy, who secured 81,108 votes.\n\nTMC’s vote share reached 53.43 per cent, compared to the BJP's 37.67 per cent, reflecting a similar outcome to 2021, when TMC had 50.72 per cent and the BJP had 40.51 per cent in this tribal-dominated seat.\n\nIn Taldangra, TMC’s Falguni Singhababu is leading with 54,327 votes, maintaining a margin of 20,273 votes over BJP’s Ananya Roy Chakraborty, who received 34,054 votes.\n\nTMC Chief Mamata Express Gratitude To Supporters\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee expressed her gratitude to the people of the state for their continued support, saying, “I would like to thank and congratulate the 'Maa, Mati, and Manush' from the bottom of my heart. Your blessings will help us work for the people in the coming days,” in a social media post.\n\nTMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee congratulated all six TMC candidates for their decisive victories, claiming they had “defied the narratives created by the Zamindars, the media, and a section of the Calcutta High Court to defame Bengal for their own vested interests.”\n\nHe also expressed special thanks to the people of Madarihat. \"I bow before the people of West Bengal for democratically dismantling the Bangla Birodhis, their fake narratives, and reaffirming their trust in us.\"\n\n‘Bypolls Not a Reliable Indicator’\n\nBJP state president Sukanta Majumdar downplayed the significance of the bypoll results. “Bypoll results cannot serve as a reliable indicator. Whether the people are with the TMC or against them will be reflected in the upcoming assembly elections,” Majumdar said.\n\nSetback For Congress-CPI(M)\n\nThe bypolls marked a significant setback for the CPI(M)-led Left Front and the Congress. The Left, accused by TMC of masterminding the prolonged doctor’s protests, failed to capitalise on the public anger surrounding the RG Kar incident, losing in all constituencies.\n\nSince the 2021 assembly elections, the TMC has won every by-election, except the Sagardighi bypoll in March 2023, which was later won by a Congress candidate who later switched to the TMC.\n\nWith this victory, TMC’s tally in the 294-member state assembly rises to 216, further consolidating its position. The BJP’s tally drops to 69, from 77 in 2021.",

		"text": "Mumbai: Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday expressed concerns over the trends emerging from the counting of votes in Maharashtra for the recently held assembly elections, saying that they have done 'gadbad' to steal Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) seats. He said that such results are being imposed because this cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra.\n\nRaut further questioned the number of seats NCP and Shinde's Shiv Sena were getting, saying that the public doesn't agree with these results.\n\n\"They have done some 'gadbad', they have stolen some of our seats. This cannot be the public's decision. Even the public does not agree with these results. Once the results are out, we will talk more. In every election seat, money-counting machines were installed. Is it possible that Shinde will get 60 seats, Ajit Pawar will get 40 seats and BJP will get 125 seats? The people of this state are not dishonest. We have their faith in the people of Maharashtra,\" Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told mediapersons in Mumbai.\n\n\"Such a result has been imposed. This cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra. We know what the people of Maharashtra want in their hearts. This cannot happen. I would like to only say that this is not the decision of people,\" Raut added.\n\nThe senior Shiv Sena (UBT) leader lashed out at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Ajit Pawar saying that his party was getting more than 40 seats.\n\n\"What did they do that they are getting more than 120 seats?\" Raut asked.\n\nMeanwhile Senior Congress leader and former MP Udit Raj once again blamed EVMS for the poor showing, “As long as there are EVMs, elections cannot be fair. The election trends of Maharashtra clearly indicate that this is the victory of EVM.”\n\nThe complaints from the INDIA bloc comes after the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance crossed the halfway mark leading on 220 seats so far, while the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance is trailing with 52 seats as per trends by the Elections Commission of India at 11 am.\n\nAccording to initial trends, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena is leading in 55 seats, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 35, and the BJP has the most, leading in 128 seats, while the Rashtriya Yuva Swabhiman Party (RYSWP), which is part of the maha Yuti alliance has one seat.",

		"text": "Dehradun: The BJP retained the Kedarnath Assembly seat in Uttarakhand, with its candidate and state Mahila Morcha president Asha Nautiyal winning the bypolls by defeating Manoj Rawat of Congress with a margin of 5,622 votes.\n\nNautiyal took an early lead in the Uttarakhand election bypolls and maintained it throughout, securing her third victory from the Kedarnath seat. She was previously elected to the state Assembly from Kedarnath in 2002 and 2007.\n\nNautiyal received 23,814 votes, while Congress' Manoj Rawat secured 18,192 votes. Independent candidate Tribhuvan Singh came in third with 9,311 votes, according to the Election Commission website.\n\nReturning officer Anil Shukla handed the victory certificate to Nautiyal in Rudraprayag.\n\nIt is a significant victory for the ruling BJP as it would have been humiliating for the party to lose another pilgrimage seat in Uttarakhand after Badrinath.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the Congress has lost the seat. In the 2022 Assembly polls, Rawat finished third after BJP's Shaila Rani Rawat and Independent candidate Kuldeep Singh Rawat.\n\nThe bypoll was necessitated due to the death of BJP MLA Shaila Rani Rawat in July. Polling was held on November 20 and a voter turnout of 57.64 per cent was recorded.\n\nChief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said this is a \"huge victory\" for the BJP and the triumph of the development work carried out in Kedarnath under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"It is a victory of development, our policies and Sanatan. It is also a slap on the faces of those who spread all sorts of lies against the state government in the run-up to the bypoll,\" he said without naming anyone.\n\nDhami said his government is committed to taking development to the last person in Kedarnath.\n\nThe chief minister also staged a roadshow from Survey Chawk to the state BJP headquarters and thanked the party workers for the win in Kedarnath.\n\nAddressing the party workers, he gave the credit for the victory to Prime Minister Modi.\n\n\"I look upon it as a victory of Modi ji. After the 2013 disaster, development projects worth more than Rs 2,000 crore were begun in Kedarnath under our Prime Minister's leadership,\" he said.\n\nThe energy generated by this victory will be utilised to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Kedarnath, Dhami said.\n\nUttarakhand BJP president Mahendra Bhatt said, \"The voters of Kedarnath have once again rejected the negative politics of the Congress. I thank them for once again placing their trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and the BJP.\" He said the negative propaganda of the Congress which tried to spread misinformation about Kedarnath Dham had no impact on people who have once again put their seal of approval on the work done in the constituency by the BJP government in the Centre and in the state.\n\nFormer Pradesh Congress President Ganesh Godiyal who had actively campaigned in favour of the party candidate in Kedarnath, said the Congress could not win the seat due to the division of the anti-establishment votes.\n\n\"Over 51,000 votes were cast in the bypoll. We could not win as we could not keep around 33,000 anti-establishment votes intact,\" Godiyal said.\n\nHowever, he congratulated both Dhami and Nautiyal for the victory in Kedarnath and expressed hope that they will honour the trust reposed by the people in them by pacing up development in the constituency.",

For the unversed, the first gen iPhone SE was launched in March 2016, while the second-gen iPhone SE arrived in April 2020 and the thrid-gen iPhone SE arrived in March 2022.\n\nIn addition to the launch timeline, the new report by MacRumours also states the iPhone SE 4 will the first device in Apple's product lineup that will debut with a 5G modem designed by the company -- a feature, which the company has been working on since 2018 to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on Qualcomm. As per separate reports, the iPhone 17 Air is also likely to come with the company's in-house 5G modem.\n\niPhone SE 4: Everything we know about it so far\n\nAs far as the specifications are concerned, reports have already detailed what we should expect from the third generation iPhone SE when it launches next year. The upcoming iPhone SE 4 is expected to feature a design that is quite similar to the iPhone 14. This would make the first iPhone SE model to ditch the Touch ID and opt for Face ID, which is a standard feature in all premium iPhone models.\n\nOn the display front, the iPhone SE 4 is tipped to get a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz screen refresh rate. The third generation iPhone SE model is expected to be powered by a new A-series chip that would bring support for some of the Apple Intelligence features to the devices. However, older reports suggested that the device could come with A18 chip.",

The action-drama entertainer was shot in 2014 but got delayed due to the demise of one of the producers of the movie, according to a press release issued by the makers. Naam is directed by Anees Bazmee. The movie is faring poorly at the box office with its two-day collection standing at just ₹30 lakh. Interestingly, on November 1 on Diwali, Ajay saw the release of Singham Again and director Anees' Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 also debuted alongside it.\n\nThey collectively minted over ₹500 crore after 2 week-run in the cinema halls. However, Ajay and Anees' Naam have seen no takers at the box office.\n\nSingham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 released on November 1 | Image: IMDb\n\nNaam box office collection detailed\n\nNaam minted ₹22 lakh on its opening day.

Kartik's success is being celebrated as an outsider's victory as he was up against Bollywood biggies like Ajay Devgn , Kareena Kapoor, Deepika Padukone and many more, who led the Singham threequel.\n\nWhile the Satyaprem Ki Katha star rang in his 34th birthday in Goa , many on social media noticed how he was not wished by his co-stars Sara Ali Khan, Ananya Panday and Kiara Advani on his special day even as it coincided with the blockbuster success of his movie.\n\nKartik Aaryan celebrated his 34th birthday in Goa | Image: X\n\nKartik compared to Sushant Singh Rajput\n\nOn social media, many pointed out how despite the tremendous success of his films at the box office, Kartik was, in a way, being sidelined in Bollywood as the industry largely snubbed him on his birthday, some being his co-stars in recent years. Many drew comparisons with how Sushant was treated while he was still alive. The MS Dhoni star passed away in Mumbai in June 2020, aged 34. After his unfortunate demise, a narrative emerged around how \"outsiders\" were treated in Bollywood despite their success.\n\nKartik Aaryan in a still from Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 | Image: X\n\nHowever, some like Kriti Sanon, Sreeleela, Ayushmann Khurrana, Rakul Preet and Shilpa Shetty celebrated Kartik's box office success and his birthday by sharing wishes on social media.\n\nKartik rings in low-key birthday in Goa\n\nKartik Aaryan, who is currently in Goa for the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), rang in his 34th birthday with his friends in the beach city. Kartik took to Instagram, where he dropped a string of pictures of himself enjoying the sun, sand and sea.

The disagreement between the two stars quickly escalated, requiring police to step in and control the situation. Videos are now going viral.\n\nOdia Director Bobby Islam & Actor Manoj Mishra’s physical altercation goes viral\n\nOn November 23, several videos emerged on social media showing the two actors fighting outside the DCP’s office. In one clip shared by OTV News on X (formerly Twitter), police officers intervene as their argument intensifies.\n\nIn the video, Odia director Bobby Islam and actor Manoj Mishra are seen attacking each other, along with fellow director Jyoti Das. Bystanders, shocked to witness two film stars fighting in public, gathered around. The footage shows the actors exchanging insults while the police attempt to break up the altercation.\n\nThe confrontation is said to have started over comments they made regarding a movie title. Both actors had gone to the DCP office to resolve their issues but ended up in a heated confrontation instead.\n\nOdia Director Bobby Islam and actor Manoj Mishra fought over the film title\n\nA report reveals that the dispute began when Manoj objected to a specific word in the title of an upcoming film. Meanwhile, Bobby accused Manoj of making negative comments about the Odia film industry.\n\n\"Apparently, the bone of contention is Manoj's opposition to the use of a word in the title of a film that a producer is making. On the other hand, Bobby alleged that Manoj has been casting aspersions on the Odia film industry,\" explained the officer, as quoted by the news portal.\n\nOdia Director Bobby Islam | Image: x\n\nManoj, however, claimed that Bobby used the first word of the film’s title to insult him when he arrived at the DCP office. \"I didn’t attack anybody. Bobby even used the word for me at a show. That’s why I lodged a police complaint,\" he said.",

		"title": "As Trump Wins Presidency In Remarkable Comeback to White House, A Look at States Voted for Him",
		"text": "Washington: The US presidential election has been a suspenseful race, but after a tough call with the running mate Kamala Harris , former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump managed to secure a historic win.\n\nRepublican nominee Trump has secured 277 Electoral College votes, while Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has 226, based on media projections.\n\nWith 270 votes required to clinch the presidency, Trump secured a historic mandate with a comeback to the White House after 4 years of Democratic rule.\n\nIn the US, winning states is more decisive than the popular vote because each state contributes a set number of electoral votes, reflecting its population.\n\nIn this election, US states are color-coded according to party alignment: red for Republicans and blue for Democrats. However, the pivotal 'purple' swing states, which often decide elections, lean neither way consistently.\n\nLet’s examine the swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for and see where things currently stand.\n\nSwing State Results\n\nSwing states, identified as 'purple' because they shift between red and blue, play an outsized role in the election outcome. Projections indicate Trump is likely to secure all the seven major swing states:\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAs per the news agency AP, p Trump won this battleground state with its 16 electoral votes. Republican turnout meanwhile surpassed 2020 levels, while Democratic voter turnout has fallen, according to AP. Trump previously won North Carolina in 2020 and has seen improved performance in Republican areas this time.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrump also emerged victorious in Georgia. He narrowly lost this state in 2020 by just under 12,000 votes, but he has reclaimed it with incremental gains in deeply red, rural counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTrump will take Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes. This state, a crucial battleground, was flipped by President Joe Biden in 2020, but Trump had previously won it in 2016, becoming the first Republican to do so since 1988.\n\nArizona\n\nTrump has also won Arizona, which accounts for 11 electoral votes.\n\nNevada\n\nNevada is leaning towards Trump, positioning him for the state's six electoral votes.\n\n\n\nPerformance in Red States\n\nRed states who are traditionally supportive of Republicans, are expected to fall in line for Trump. These states typically prioritize conservative values, favor limited government intervention, and are largely rural and suburban. States like Texas, Alabama, and Wyoming are classified as red and have shown continued support for Trump in this election and helped him secure victory.\n\nUtah\n\nDonald Trump won Utah and its six electoral votes in the 2024 US presidential election. Utah has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964.\n\nIdaho\n\nMarking his third consecutive victory in another US state, Trump won Idaho with 60 per cent of the total vote in this election. The state has always been a consistent supporter of Re[publicans.\n\nKansas\n\nThe Republicans won Kansas by securing its six electoral votes and marking the third consecutive victory for Trump, one again.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa's six electoral votes went straight to Donald Trump making him the thirst consecutive winner of the state.\n\nMissouri\n\nTrump also bagged Missouri's 10 electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election. The state has long been a reliable stronghold for Republicans.\n\nTexas\n\nThe former president also won Texas by securing its 40 electoral votes. This did not come as a surprise as the state has leaned towards the Republican in recent presidential races.\n\nOhio\n\nTrump also won Ohio, a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential election. The Republicans bagged 16 electoral votes in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nWinning Wyoming in both 2016 and 2020 with a great margin, Trump won the state this time as well in the presidential race.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDonald Trump won Louisiana with eight electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election. He won the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSecuring three electoral votes, Trump won South Dakota in the 2024 presidential election. South Dakota has always been one of the biggest supporters of the Republican nominee.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nSimilar to South Dakota, Trump won North Dakota as well by securing three electoral votes.\n\nArkansas\n\nThe former president won Arkansas by bagging six electoral votes in the state. This marks his third consecutive victory in this state.\n\nFlorida\n\nIn a not-so-surprising result, Trump won Florida by capturing 30 electoral votes in this presidential race. The state has never supported a Democrat since 1012.\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee, a state that always has been a Republican supporter since the 1990s, gave Trump its 11 electoral votes in this presidential race.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi was won by the former president by sis electoral votes. The state has been a Republican supporter since 1976.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGiving the former president nine electoral voters, South Carolina made Trump win the state for the third consecutive term.\n\nOklahoma\n\nThe state has not supported a Democrat since 1964, and this time too the Republican won it by seven electoral votes.\n\nAlabama\n\nWinning nine electoral votes in the third state, Trump won Alabama in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nTrump won West Virginia with four electoral votes in this presidential race.\n\nIndiana",

		"text": "Peshawar: At least 37 people were killed and several others injured in tribal sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province over last 24 hours, police said on Saturday even as government officials said negotiations with local and tribal elders to restore peace are progressing successfully.\n\nThe clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, in northwest Pakistan took place following Thursday's attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed.\n\nChief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has issued clear instructions to resolve all issues through dialogue and negotiations, ensuring long-term stability in the region, a government spokesperson said.\n\n“At least 37 are dead as at now,” an official tasked with collecting details of the carnage told the media here. More than 30 people are injured, he added.\n\nThe tribes are targeting each other with heavy and automatic weapons, police said.\n\nHomes and shops have been damaged in the fighting and people from various villages have fled to safer locations.\n\nAll educational institutions in the district remained closed on Saturday, confirmed Muhammad Hayat Hassan, chairman of the Private Education Network.\n\nVideos shared from the area showed at least six bodies of the attackers and some charred bodies of the victims. Police also said that there were reports of six women taken as captives but “due to limited connectivity, information and communication is scant to ascertain anything more.” Gunfire continued in Balishkhel, Khar Kali, Kunj Alizai and Maqbal through the day, police said, adding, currently there is intermittent firing from at least three areas in the district, while the Thall-Sada-Parachinar Highway remained closed from traffic towards Kohat district.\n\nAs officials struggled to reinforce peace in the volatile region, communication from the elders of both the tribal sects suggested further intensified attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the KP provincial government dismissed reports of firing at a helicopter carrying a high-level government delegation comprising Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Law Minister, Chief Secretary and Inspector General of Police going towards the Kurram tribal district.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa government spokesman Barrister Dr Saif dismissed as “baseless” the reports of firing on the helicopter in Parachinar area and confirmed that the delegation was completely safe.\n\nThe government delegation was engaged in dialogue with local leaders and tribal elders in Kurram to restore peace and stability following the directives of the chief minister, the spokesman said, adding, peace negotiations were progressing successfully between the two sides.\n\nThe government's top priority was facilitating a ceasefire between the two parties and establishing a lasting peace, he added.\n\nIn the first phase, constructive meetings were held with Shia community leaders, during which critical issues were discussed in depth while in the next phase, deliberations would be conducted with the Sunni community leaders, he added.\n\nThe government's top priority is to facilitate a ceasefire between both parties and establish lasting peace, the spokesperson added.\n\nTribal leaders have already expressed deep concerns as for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel for common citizens.\n\nTwo weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.\n\nIn September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.\n\nThe intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.\n\nThe road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.\n\nThe fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.",

		"text": "Norwegian Student Arrested on Suspicion of Spying for Russia and Iran While Working at US Embassy | Image: Freepik\n\nOslo: A Norwegian student in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia and Iran while working as a security guard at the US Embassy in Oslo. The man, whose name has not been made public, has been ordered to stay in custody for four weeks. He also runs a security company with a dual Norwegian and Eastern European citizen.\n\nAccording to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, following the arrest of the student, the Norwegian police said that they would review the company's operating license. The country’s intelligence agency, PST, said the man was arrested at his home on Wednesday for activities that could harm national security.\n\nThe police found records showing that the man had been in contact with someone who appeared to be directing his spying activities. The man has admitted to gathering and sharing information with Russian and Iranian authorities.\n\nThe court documents state that the man has confessed, but his lawyer, John Christian Elden, says the man does not accept the full charge of espionage. Instead, he admits to working for a foreign country but denies that he intended to harm the security of other countries.\n\nThe man is studying for a degree in security and preparedness at Norway’s Arctic University (UiT). This is the second case involving UiT in recent years. In 2022, a guest researcher at the university, who had claimed to be Brazilian, was arrested for espionage. It was later revealed that he was actually a Russian spy.",

A New York judge granted permission to Trump, who was recently voted to power on November 5 as the next President of the United States for the second term.

As a result, sentencing in the case has been postponed indefinitely amidst both sides debating the future of the case in the wake of Trump’s recent electoral win.",

		"text": "What was feared became a stark reality as yet again Indian batters could not straightaway acclimatize to the foreign conditions. Batting first, India endured a nasty collapse and eventually bundled out at a score of 150. It was advantage Australia till then but Jasprit Bumrah turned the tide and rattled the Aussies in their backyard at the pacers paradise in Perth.\n\nJasprit Bumrah Gets Special Praise From Aakash Chopra\n\nHaving taken the captaincy onus in the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah has led from the front and left Australia reeling. First, he removed the openers cheaply, then got rid of the mighty Steve Smith on the first ball. Later in the day, he took the scalp of Marnus Labuschagne as well. Bumrah finished the day with outstanding figures of 10 overs 17 runs and four wickets. Moreover, in response to India's 150, Australia are beleaguered at 67/7 at Stumps on Day 1 of the 1st Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nWith this exceptional performance, Jasprit Bumrah has gained worldwide acclaim. Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra is also on the list of individuals who have showered praise on Bumrah. Chopra hailed Jasprit Bumrah as the \"Rolls-Royce of fast bowling.\"\n\n\"The way Jasprit Bumrah brought India back into the game was worth watching because when India were all out for 150, it seemed like it was over and out. However, it was not over and out. Jassi jaisa koi nahin. He is 24-carat pure gold,\" he said.",

		"text": "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has dropped a bombshell ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 auction by releasing a list of bowlers with suspect actions, including two big names who have been banned from bowling.\n\nTwo big names banned for suspect action ahead of IPL 2025 auction\n\nFormer Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) batter Manish Pandey (Karnataka State Cricket Association) and Shrijith Krishnan (Karnataka State Cricket Association) have been barred from bowling due to their suspect actions.\n\nAdditionally, three other bowlers, Deepak Hooda (Rajasthan Cricket Association), Saurabh Dubey (Vidarbha Cricket Association), and KC Cariappa (Cricket Association of Mizoram), have been placed in the suspect list. This comes just days before the IPL 2025 auction, which is slated to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on November 24 and 25.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, the BCCI has communicated this to the IPL franchises ahead of the auction. This move by the BCCI has sent shockwaves among the IPL franchises, who were gearing up for the auction. The banning of Manish Pandey in particular, will come as a blow to his team, as he is an experienced player who has been integral to his team's success.\n\nMeanwhile, the BCCI has also unveiled the schedules for the next three Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons, providing unprecedented clarity and foresight for the coveted T20 tournament. The upcoming 2025 season will commence on March 14 (Friday) and culminate on May 25 (Sunday).\n\nMoreover, the BCCI has announced the dates for the subsequent two seasons. The IPL 2026 season will begin on March 15 (Sunday) and conclude on May 31 (Sunday). The IPL 2027 season will start on March 14 (Sunday) and end on May 30 (Sunday).",

The batting failure seemingly affected his fielding as well. The Indian batter dropped a sitter to give Marnus Labuschagne a chance, which on another day could have punished India dearly.

Barring the dropped catch by Virat Kohli, all the other airborne to the keeper and adjacent to him met with a pair of safe hands. Kohli received severe flak for putting down an easy take.

		"title": "'The Sound It Made': Mitchell Starc Gives His Verdict on KL Rahul's Controversial Dismissal",
		"text": "Australian pacer Mitchell Starc downplayed the controversy surrounding KL Rahul's disputed caught-behind dismissal on the first day of the opening Test, simply stating it was a \"regulation wicket\". Rahul's dismissal sparked debate among former players from both teams, questioning the third umpire's decision to overturn the on-field official's initial not-out call.\n\nAfter on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough initially ruled in Rahul's favor, Australia challenged the decision using DRS. However, third umpire Richard Illingworth overturned the call without the benefit of a split-screen view, which would have provided a clearer picture of whether the ball grazed the bat or triggered the snicko response due to a hit on the pads. Despite the controversy, Mitchell Starc remained unfazed, focusing on the game ahead.\n\nMitchell Starc opens up on KL Rahul's dismissal\n\n\"It got overturned obviously, but I thought it was regulation, the sound it made, the timing of it, I thought it was just a regulation wicket,\" Starc said at a press conference.\n\nStarc (2/14), who bagged the opening wicket of the series when he removed Yashasvi Jaiswal, will resume on six not out alongside wicketkeeper Alex Carey, who is unbeaten on 19, on Saturday, with Australia at 67/7 after India made 150 in their first innings.\n\nA staggering 17 wickets fell on the opening day, a record on Australian soil, but the leading pacer believed batting is going to get easier in the second innings and they just need to survive the new Kookaburra ball.\n\n\"I think there was a fair bit of good bowling today. Obviously, there was enough in the wicket and it probably felt like it was a hardball wicket,\" Starc said.\n\n\"When the ball started to get a little bit softer towards the back end of that Indian innings, it probably didn't do as much. (There was) still enough there, but it didn't do as much as the brand new hardball.\n\n\"So I guess that's something for teams to take in the second innings.\n\n\"If you can get through the testing period, it does get slightly easier. That being said, the outfield is quite slow, so that probably made runs a bit hard to come by. That's probably the slowest outfield we've seen over in the west for a long time.\"\n\nWhile Mitchell Starc gave the first breakthrough, his pace-bowling colleague Josh Hazlewood proved to be more successful on the day, returning with excellent figures of 4/29 in 13 overs before the peerless Jasprit Bumrah (4/17 in 10 overs) yet again displayed his extraordinary skills.\n\nStarc is also not of the view that batting conditions were becoming harder across Australia.\n\n\"How many ways can you skin a cat? Bowlers are allowed to bowl good balls,\" he said.\n\n\"When there's a lot of runs, it's like, 'Oh, the bowlers bowled badly. When there's wickets, the wickets are tough'. (But) you are allowed to bowl good balls and maybe credit should go to both teams and bowlers.\n\n\"Sure, there's plenty in the wicket when you put it in the right area and it was hard work for batting, but as I said, you're allowed to bowl good balls and there were plenty of those today.\"\n\nAt stumps, Australia trailed by 83 runs thanks to the incredible comeback by the Bumrah-led Indian team, something that seemed improbable after they were all out for an under-par score and weeks after their unprecedented 0-3 drubbing to New Zealand at home.\n\nStarc said he was not surprised by India's comeback.\n\n\"That was a completely different series, different conditions, different teams, so, yeah, that was entertaining to watch, that series .. but we know how good a team India are and they have shown that today.\n\n\"I thought we bowled quite well and perhaps an under-par score and they have come out and matched us with the ball, so, no, I wouldn't say I was surprised as we know the skill they have got in that team with bat and ball, and they showed that with the ball today,\" Starc pointed out.",

		"text": "Sebi on Friday exempted promoter Roshni Nadar Malhotra from making open offers in relation to proposed additional share acquisitions in HCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems.\n\nHCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems are listed on BSE and NSE.\n\nThe orders came after Roshni Nadar Malhotra filed two separate applications with the regulator on September 30 and sought exemption from provisions of Sebi's SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) regulations.\n\nGranting an exemption from the open offer, Sebi noted that the proposed acquisitions are part of a family succession plan, ensuring stability and continuity in ownership and control of the two companies.\n\nSebi, in two separate orders, allowed Roshni Nadar Malhotra to indirectly acquire shares in HCL Corporation and Vama Sundari Investments (Delhi) Pvt Ltd -- two promoters of HCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems -- through inter-generational gifting from her father Shiv Nadar.\n\nMalhotra will acquire a 47 per cent stake each in HCL Corporation and Vama Sundari Investments, the promoters of HCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems.\n\nCurrently, she holds a 10.33 per cent stake each in the two promoter entities.\n\nAfter acquiring additional shares from her father, Malhotra's stake in HCL Corporation and Vama Sundari Investments will rise to 57.33 per cent.\n\nPost-acquisition of shares, there will be no impact on promoter holding in HCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems, which will remain unchanged at 60.82 per cent and 62.89 per cent, respectively.\n\nIn its order, Sebi said the acquisitions qualify as inter-se promoter transfers between immediate relatives and fulfil conditions under the Takeover Regulations for exemption from open offer obligations.\n\nThe board cited precedence from similar cases, including that of Nuvoco Vistas Corporation, and affirmed that there is no adverse impact on public shareholders.\n\nMalhotra's acquisition of shares in HCL Corp and Vama Sundari Investments also resulted in the indirect acquisition of shares and voting rights in the two companies - HCL Technologies and HCL Infosystems.\n\nHowever, the markets watchdog emphasised that the transfers are non-commercial in nature, aimed solely at family reorganisation and succession planning.\n\n\"I, in exercise of the powers under regulation of the Takeover Regulations, 2011, hereby grant exemption to the proposed acquirer, viz., Roshni Nadar Malhotra, from complying with the requirements of the Takeover Regulations, 2011, with respect to the proposed indirect acquisition in HCL Infosystems Ltd and HCL Technologies,\" Sebi's whole time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the similarly worded two separate orders.\n\nFurther, Sebi said the exemption granted is limited to the requirements of making an open offer under the Takeover Regulations, 2011, and will not be construed as an exemption from the disclosure requirements.",

The existing zinc and new incubated businesses will remain under Vedanta Ltd.\n\n\"A meeting of the equity shareholders... be convened and held within 90 days from the date of receipt of the order,\" said a two-member bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) comprising Technical Member Madhu Sinha and Judicial Member Reeta Kohli in its order dated November 21.\n\nVedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal had earlier said the proposed demerger of the company's diverse verticals that represent more than 15 commodities will see it progress from being asset managers to asset owners.\n\nAs the company passes through the transition phase, Vedanta is focusing on consolidating and strengthening its asset base to emerge as a world leader in each of its verticals, the chairman had said.\n\nThe diversified natural resources company had moved the NCLT seeking a demerger after receiving a nod from lenders and had expressed hopes of completing the process by the end of this fiscal year.\n\nVedanta had received approval from 75 per cent of secured creditors for the proposed demerger of its businesses.\n\nThe demerger will help simplify the company's corporate structure by creating independent businesses. Moreover, it will offer global investors direct investment opportunities in pure-play companies linked to the country's impressive growth.\n\nThe demerger will allow the individual units to pursue strategic agendas more freely and better align with customers, investment cycles, and end markets.\n\nFrom FY24 onwards, the company is investing $1.9 billion as growth capex across its businesses.",

As per an official statement by RBI, the agreement aims to facilitate the use of INR and MVR in various economic and financial transactions between both the countries.\n\nIt covers current account transactions, permissible capital account transactions, and other agreed-upon activities. This initiative is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs and settlement time, making cross-border trade more efficient.\n\nRBI said, \"This framework would enable exporters and importers to invoice and settle in their respective domestic currencies, which in turn would enable the development of trading in INR-MVR pair in foreign exchange market\".\n\nUnder this framework, exporters and importers from both nations can invoice and settle trade transactions in their respective domestic currencies. This is likely to pave the way for the development of trading in the INR-MVR currency pair in the foreign exchange market.\n\nBy reducing dependence on third-party currencies, such as the US Dollar, the agreement will also optimize trade and financial operations between India and the Maldives\n\nThe collaboration also represents an important milestone in strengthening bilateral ties between the RBI and MMA.\n\nRBI stated, \"Use of local currencies in bilateral transactions will eventually contribute to promoting trade between India and Maldives as well as deepen financial integration and strengthen the economic relations between India and Maldives\".\n\nThis initiative highlighted the commitment of both India and the Maldives to strengthen their economic partnership and promote sustainable growth in the region.",

		"text": "New Delhi: India's economy is projected to grow at a faster pace in the third quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2024) compared to the first half (April-September 2024), according to a report by ICRA.\n\nThe report stated that this optimism is based on improving economic indicators and robust activity levels in various sectors. The report added that the preliminary data for November 2024 indicates a positive trend.\n\nThe growth in electricity demand has picked up due to a favourable base effect, while festive season demand continues to drive an increase in vehicle registrations.\n\nIt said \"These trends reinforce ICRA's expectations of a pick-up in the GDP growth in Q3 FY2025 as compared to H1 FY2025\".\n\nAs per the report, several indicators related to mobility and transportation have shown significant improvement. Vehicle registrations surged to 32.4 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, a sharp recovery from a contraction of 8.7 per cent in September 2024.\n\nThis increase was fueled by strong demand for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles. Petrol consumption rose to 8.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in September, and domestic air passenger traffic increased to 9.6 per cent from 6.4 per cent.\n\nAdditionally, two-wheeler production grew by 13.4 per cent, rail freight improved to 1.5 per cent from a decline of 0.7 per cent, and diesel consumption recorded marginal growth of 0.1 per cent after a contraction of 1.9 per cent in September.\n\nThe report also added that the country's non-oil exports also posted a strong performance, growing by 25.6 per cent in October 2024 compared to 6.8 per cent in September. Key contributors to this growth include electronic goods, engineering goods, chemicals, and readymade garments.\n\nThe ICRA's Business Activity Monitor, a composite indicator of economic activity, showed a year-on-year growth of 10.1 per cent in October 2024, the highest in eight months. This is an improvement from the 6.6 per cent growth recorded in September 2024, despite challenges from a high base effect.",

The falls were the largest since the Adani Group came under a short-seller attack in February 2023.\n\nAccording to an indictment, some conspirators referred privately to Gautam Adani with the code names \"Numero uno\" and \"the big man,\" while Sagar Adani allegedly used his cellphone to track specifics about the bribes.\n\nThe Adani Group has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nGautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Jaain were charged with securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, and the Adanis were also charged in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case.\n\nFive other defendants were charged with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. anti-bribery law, and four were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice.\n\nNone of the defendants is in custody, a spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn said.

		"title": "Trump Unleashing Tariffs On China In Early 2025? What Do Chinese Economists Think?",
		"text": "The United States is likely to impose nearly 40% tariffs on imports from China early next year, according to media reports.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is set to take office from January onwards, and he pledged during his campaign to slap heavy tariffs on Chinese imports in line with his \"America First\" trade policy. This has caused a lot of discomfort to Beijing and has increased growth risks for China.\n\nReuters recently conducted a poll of economists which showed the tariffs posed by the United States could slice growth in the country by up to 1 percentage point.\n\nAs compared to the earlier tariff rates, which were 7.5%-25% that the US levied from China, the threatened tariff rates are much higher during Trump's first term and the economy is also in a much more vulnerable position due to prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand.\n\nThe poll was conducted between more than 50 economists from November 13- November 20 and it showed a strong majority both in and outside mainland China, as it expects Trump to impose these tariffs by early next year with a median estimate of 38% and projections ranging from 15% to 60%.\n\nWhat Do These Economists Think?\n\nMost of these economists do not expect a blanket 60% tariffs on Chinese goods in the first half of the year as this will accelerate inflation within the US.\n\n\"We expect the new U.S. administration to bring back the original plan of Trump 1.0,\" ANZ's chief economist Raymond Yeung said, estimating that the average tariff on Chinese goods could be raised by 32–37%.\n\nChinese policymakers have been pressured with the domestic demand to offset an expected drop in exports - a key driver of growth, according to analysts.\n\nThe poll predicted that the new US tariffs would reduce China's 2025 economic growth by around 0.5-1.0 percentage point.\n\nAll economists are eagerly waiting for trump administration's China trade policies which could lead to potential downgrades in China's outlook.\n\nHowever, they still hope that exports will be a key pillar for growth as the global demands remain strong.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters have also lowered their consumer price inflation forecasts to 1.1% for next year and 1.4% for 2026, down from the previously anticipated 1.4% and 1.6% in the October survey.",

		"text": "Nayanthara-Dhanush Feud Timeline: The actors are currently embroiled in a public dispute. The Jawan actress has written a three-page letter that slammed Dhanush for sending a legal notice demanding Rs 10 crore in damages after the trailer of the documentary, titled Nayanthara: Beyond The Fairy Tale, was released online. However, the actor duo were once good friends.\n\nNayanthara-Dhanush friendship dates back to 2008\n\nNayanthara and Dhanush shared the screenspace in the 2008 film Yaaradi Nee Mohini. Their chemistry in the romantic drama was widely appreciated critically and commercially. The actors became good friends on the set of the film and this was reflected in the promotional event of the movie.\n\n\n\nA file photo of Nayanthara | Image: Instagram\n\nTheir chemistry was not just appreciated in the movie but also in the pre-release events. They went on to star together in several hit films like Maari (2015), Kaashmora (2016), Ethir Neechal (2013) and Kuselan (2008) among others.\n\nWhen Dhanush's film Naanum Rowdy Dhan gave Nayanthara's career a new lease of life after comeback\n\nIn 2011, Nayanthara decided to quit films. This decision is now being linked to her alleged affair with Prabhudeva, who reportedly stopped her from working in films. However, when the Lady Superstar decided to make a comeback in 2013, the film Raja Rani emerged as a box-office blockbuster.\n\n\n\nNayanthara and Vijay Sethupati in <i>Naanum Rowdy Dhan | Image: X</i>\n\nThe projects following this did not work out well for the actress. It was only in 2015 that Nayanthara gave a hit with Naanum Rowdy Dhan which was directed by her husband Vijay Sethupathi. The movie was produced by Dhanush. The roots of animosity between the actors were sowed during the production of the film Naanum Rowdy Dhan.\n\nHow Naanum Rowdy Dhan became a bone of contention between Nayanthara and Dhanush\n\nThe 2015 film was produced by Dhanush and was directed by Nayanthara's husband Vignesh Sivan. It was reported that the 3 actor was not happy with the production of the film and the performance of the actress. It was alleged that Sivan exceeded the film's budget for which the actress had to pitch in funds from her own pocket.\n\n\n\nNayanthara and Vijay Sethupati in <i>Naanum Rowdy Dhan | Image: X</i>\n\nEven though the film was a success at the box office, it was said that it was a financial liability for Dhanush. The delays in production led to massive cost overruns on the film. This led to a cold war between Nayanthara and Dhanush.\n\nWhen Nayanthara took an indirect dig at Dhanush for the first time\n\nNayanthara and Dhanush in a selfie | Image: X\n\nNayanthara's performance in Naanum Rowdy Dhan was widely appreciated by the critics and audience alike. However, it was said that Dhanush did not like her acting in the project. The actress even won several awards for her role and during the acceptance speech at one such event, she said, \"Thank you, Dhanush, for initiating NRD (Naanum Rowdy Dhaan), and I have to say I am sorry also. Dhanush absolutely hated my performance in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. Sorry Dhanush for disappointing you with my performance. I’ll probably make it better next time.”\n\nNayanthara exposes Dhanush in her documentary\n\nNayanthara planned a documentary on her love life with Vignesh Shivan which featured parts of Naanum Rowdy Dhan. Even after a 2-year long battle, Dhanush refused to give an NOC to the actress to use the clips from his production. This led to the documentary being pivoted to another direction and focusing on her entire life. This led to the actress writing a 3-page open letter to the actor. The 39-year-old actor said she was shocked after receiving a legal notice for using a three-second behind-the-scenes clip in the documentary.",

		"title": "Adaptive Defence is Essential, Not Optional, Says India's Defence Minister at Defence Dialogue",
		"text": "New Delhi, India- In a call to address the rapidly evolving global threat landscape, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh outlined India’s commitment to building an \"Adaptive Defence\" approach. Speaking at the inaugural session of the Delhi Defence Dialogue (DDD) in New Delhi, hosted by the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), Singh underscored the Modi-led government’s focus on creating a resilient, technologically advanced defence framework to counter modern security challenges. The theme of this year’s conference, “Adaptive Defence: Navigating the Changing Landscape of Modern Warfare”, provided a timely platform for exploring collaborative approaches in defence strategy, with the dialogue drawing participation from policy experts, military leaders, and strategic scholars.\n\nRaksha Mantri highlighted adaptive defence as essential in the modern security context, characterizing it as a proactive rather than reactive strategy. “Adaptive Defence is not just a strategic choice; it is a necessity in our fast-paced world. Today’s defence demands continuous evolution to counter emergent threats effectively,” he stated. This approach, he explained, encompasses situational awareness, flexibility at strategic and tactical levels, resilience, and integration with next-generation technologies. “It is about cultivating the mindset to anticipate challenges and prepare proactively for the unknown,” Singh emphasized, urging the military to embrace agility and innovation.\n\nRedefining Warfare: The Role of Emerging Technologies\n\nSingh noted that warfare is increasingly conducted in the Grey Zone—where traditional tactics are augmented by unconventional methods like cyber and hybrid warfare. Emphasizing that conventional defensive measures must now adapt to these evolving tactics, he detailed India’s focus on leveraging emerging technologies such as drones, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and quantum computing. “India aspires to become a global hub for drone technology, contributing to our ‘Make in India’ and Aatmanirbhar Bharat programs,” he said. Singh highlighted initiatives such as the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) and ADITI schemes that incentivize domestic innovation in defence technology, strengthening India’s military-industrial ecosystem.\n\nStressing the importance of collective responses to shared security challenges, Singh remarked, “Interconnectedness is as much a blessing as it is a challenge. If our threats are transnational, so should be our solutions.” In his address, he advocated for collaboration across states and institutions to address threats that transcend national borders. As cyber threats, hybrid warfare, and technological advancements reshape the global security environment, the Defence Minister argued that India must adopt a multifaceted approach that fosters joint responses among states, non-state actors, and private sector partners.\n\nStrengthening the Defence Ecosystem\n\nTo secure India’s defence capabilities, the government has introduced numerous initiatives promoting indigenous development and self-reliance. Singh cited examples of significant achievements, including the domestically produced Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, and missile systems developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). “These projects exemplify our commitment to self-reliance without isolation. We welcome foreign collaboration in R&D, co-production, and joint ventures, all within the broader framework of Make in India,” he asserted.\n\nAcknowledging the necessity of international cooperation, he noted that global interdependence allows nations to overcome resource and technological limitations. Singh argued that the pursuit of robust defence systems in today’s globalised economy requires logical collaboration to access broader expertise, economies of scale, and advanced technology.\n\nIn light of today’s digital threats, Singh addressed the rise of psychological and information warfare, calling it an unprecedented challenge to national security. “The government is resolute in employing adaptive defence strategies to counter these digital threats,” he affirmed. This stance reflects the government’s dedication to maintaining a forward-looking posture against both physical and psychological warfare, with special emphasis on countering misinformation and cyber-attacks.\n\nDefence Exports: Pushing for Economic Growth and Strategic Reach\n\nIndia has also set ambitious goals for expanding its defence exports, aiming to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. Notably, India’s defence exports now reach over 100 nations, with the United States, France, and Armenia as top recipients in 2023-24. Singh emphasized that these exports not only contribute to the nation’s economic goals but also bolster its strategic reach and global presence.\n\nThe Delhi Defence Dialogue serves as MP-IDSA’s flagship platform for addressing complex defence challenges, and fostering dialogue among policymakers, military experts, and scholars on the changing landscape of security.\n\nThe defence minister commended the DDD’s role in facilitating informed discussions and generating strategies for enhancing India’s defence posture. He expressed confidence that the DDD would pave the way for stronger strategic partnerships and more robust national security frameworks through shared expertise and collaborative innovation.",

You now have the instruments, the instruments necessary to advance science in so many different fields,\" Huang said.\n\n\"The greatest challenges of our time, unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past, all of a sudden seem possible to tackle.\"",

The plaintiffs contend Tesla knew about the alleged defect as early as 2015 and did not warn customers.\n\nTesla denied that it had knowledge of the alleged braking defect before one of the plaintiffs purchased his vehicle in early 2021.\n\nThe company argued that the plaintiffs had not pointed to any specific communications with buyers that concealed information about the defect.\n\nAlexakis said the lawsuit “successfully connects the dots” between Tesla’s alleged omission of safety information on its website and buyers' reliance on the website to make purchase decisions.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiffs could file an amended complaint seeking to revive their insurance premium claims.",

		"title": "Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Feature Loaded SUV with Better Boot Space",
		"text": "Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra recently updated the XUV 300 in India and gave it a new name: XUV 3XO. It is a sub-4m compact SUV with turbo petrol and diesel engines. It has a comfortable cabin and offers a multitude of features such as driving modes, a wireless charger, and more. The company provides two turbo petrol engine options, two IRVM (Internal Rear View Mirror) options, and two sunroof options across variants.\n\nMahindra has revised the exterior design, updated the interiors, and added some first-in-segment features such as dual-zone climate control, and a powerful diesel engine with highest torque in the segment. The XUV 3XO competes against the Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, and Kia Sonet in its segment.\n\nWe got our hands on the Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7 L variant with a TGDI petrol engine and here are our thoughts about the SUV.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Price:\n\nThe price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO starts at Rs 7.79 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base MX2 1.2 Petrol variant and it goes all the way up to Rs 15.49 lakh (ex-showroom) for the AX7 L 1.2 Petrol AT variant.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Exterior Design:\n\nThe exterior design of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is revised and gets a new front and rear profile. Starting with the front, there are all LED headlamps and DRLs and the fog lamps are also LED. The LED headlights gave great visibility at night while cruising on highways. There are front parking cameras and sensors to ease out parking in tight spaces. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300’s figure of 180mm.\n\nOn the side, the length and proportions remain unchanged. The top-spec variant runs on 17-inch alloy wheels with front and rear disc brakes. The in-rest and the eg-rest into the SUV is easy. The XUV 3XO is available in eight colour options with top-spec AX7 and AX7 L versions distinguishable by their contrasting roofs.\n\nAt the rear, the XUV 3XO gets a connected LED DRL and LED taillight setup with a subtle roof spoiler. Mahindra could have offered a shark-fin antenna instead of the regular pole antenna, which would have enhance the look and feel of the SUV. Nonetheless, it still looks appealing.\n\nThe boot space is still an issue in the XUV 3XO and is the least in the segment. With the parcel tray in, there's hardly any space for big luggage to fit in the boot. The rear bumper gets a black and silver accent, enhancing the sporty aesthetics of the SUV.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Interiors:\n\nAs we step inside, the interiors of the XUV 3XO have been revised and the cabin quality has received significant improvements over the XUV 300. The dashboard gets a soft-touch finish on the top-spec trim and the centre console gets gloss black, which attracts a lot of fingerprints. The perforated seats look upmarket but the cream colour upholstery would require maintenance and regular dry-cleanings. The dashboard gets the 10.25-inch infotainment system and the instrument cluster is inspired by the XUV 700 as it gets the 10.25-inch digital dials.\n\nSince the Mahindra XUV 3XO has a wheelbase of 2,600mm, the space inside is decent. The rear seats offer comfortable seating and there is ample knee room, legroom, and shoulder room for three passengers. The presence of the rear AC vents and USB type-C charging ports enhances the rear seat experience.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Features:\n\nWith the XUV 3XO, Mahindra has added some new features and deleted some others. We tested the AX7 L variant of the SUV, which hosted a 10.25-inch infotainment screen. This screen offers a 360-degree view of the parking cameras, which offers decent resolution even in the dark. However, we experienced some lag in the feed of the 360-degree camera. Additionally, the Mahindra XUV 3XO misses out on support for Apple CarPlay, which is a major bummer for iPhone users.\n\nComing to the audio, our test unit was equipped with two tweeters, a four-speaker, and a subwoofer Harman Kardon sound system. The sound output was good and elevated the driving experience.\n\nBeyond the above mentioned features, the XUV 3XO also offers dual-zone climate control, and auto-dimming IRVM, which are missing in its elder sibling, the Mahindra XUV 700. It also includes a 65W fast-charging Type-C port -- a feature exclusive to the XUV 3XO -- that can even charge laptops. With the facelift, Mahindra has also included an electronic parking brake with an auto hold function, enhancing the driving experience. Our test unit was equipped with a panoramic sunroof. Operating it led to a call to the driver's Emergency SOS contact, which is a major glitch in the SUV's system. Despite offering multiple top-of-the-line features such as X and Y, it misses out on some other key features such as front-ventilated seats, ambient lighting, and paddle shifters in the automatic transmission.\n\nTalking about safety, Mahindra XUV 3XO recently scored a five-star safety rating for the adult occupants in the Bharat NCAP. It is offered with six airbags, ABS, EBD, traction control, and more. The higher spec variants are offered with tyre pressure monitoring system and blind view monitor.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Engine and Driving Experience:\n\nMahindra offers the XUV 3XO with a 1.2-litre MPFI turbo petrol engine, a 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine, and a 1.5-litre diesel engine. We tested the 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine with a six-speed torque converter gearbox. The 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine is an in-line three-cylinder unit and produces 130 BHP and 230 Nm torque, mated to a six-speed manual or a torque converter gearbox.\n\nThe drive of the XUV 3XO is smooth despite being a three-cylinder engine. It is refined and the vibrations are evident at certain levels or in the higher band of the rev range. The steering is smooth and feels disconnected and the body roll is present\n\nThere are three riding modes on offer: Zip, Zap, and Zoom. While the Zip mode is Mahindra's word for the Eco mode, the Zap mode is the Normal mode and the Zoom Mode is the Sports Mode. We kept the vehicle on Zip mode for maximum time to gain better fuel efficiency and the experience was decent. The SUV was punchy with the sudden throttle inputs and the power was available post 2000 RPM.\n\nMahindra offers camera and radar-based Level-2 ADAS features on the XUV 3XO and those worked effortlessly in our test. The Adaptive Cruise Control maintained the speed and distance from the vehicle ahead the Lane Keep Assist maintained the lane on highways. The auto high-beam assist elevated the night drive experience. All the features we tried worked well but what does need a reshuffle is the menu for ADAS. It is tucked into the digital dials, which isn’t quick to access and requires driver attention.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Fuel Efficiency:\n\nMahindra claims a fuel efficiency of 18.2 km/l for the 1.2-litre TGDI petrol automatic variant. During our test, the car showed a fuel efficiency of 15.5 km/l on the MID. Also, it would not make an upshift to the sixth gear unless the car crosses a speed of 90 km/h. Till then the car would be in the fifth gear with a speed of around 85 km/h sticking to 2000-2100 RPM, thus hampering the fuel efficiency.\n\nAlso Read: Top three automakers in PV segment with highest EV sales in October 2024\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Suspension:\n\nThe suspensions of the XUV 3XO are tuned on the softer side. It provided a comfortable ride in the city but became bouncy at triple-digit speeds and bad patches filtered inside the cabin. There was decent cabin insulation and only suspension noise was evident.\n\nConclusion:",

		"text": "Amazon.com pumped another $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, as the e-commerce giant goes up against Big Tech rivals in a race to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nThis doubles Amazon's investment in the firm known for its GenAI chatbot Claude, but it remains a minority investor, the startup said on Friday. Similar to Amazon's previous $4 billion investment, it comes in the form of convertible notes and comes in phases, first at $1.3 billion.\n\nAnthropic is also in talks with additional investors to raise more capital on the back of Amazon backing, sources added, who requested anonymity for discussing private matters. Anthropic declined to comment.\n\nAmazon, which has gradually established itself as Anthropic's primary cloud partner, is fiercely competing with Microsoft and Alphabet's Google to offer AI-powered tools for its cloud customers. AWS is bringing significant revenue to Anthropic as a major distributor of its latest models.\n\n\"The investment in Anthropic is essential for Amazon to stay in a leadership position in AI,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nThe e-commerce company's increased investment in Anthropic underscores the billions of dollars funneled into AI startups over the past year, as investors look to cash in on a boom in the technology, which became popular with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI raised $6.6 billion from investors last month, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\n\nAnthropic plans to train and deploy its foundational models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. The intensive process of training AI models requires powerful processors, making securing pricey AI chips a top priority for startups.\n\n\"It (partnership) also allows Amazon to promote its AI services such as leveraging its AI chips for training and inferencing, which Anthropic is using,\" Luria said.\n\nNvidia currently dominates the market for AI processors and counts Amazon among its long list of so-called hyperscaler customers.\n\nStill, Amazon has been working to develop its own chips through its Annapurna Labs division, which Anthropic said it was \"working closely with\" to aid in developing processors. Amazon has also been trying to build its own AI model code-named “Olympus,” which it hasn't released.\n\nAnthropic, co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, said last year it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time.",

		"text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly appointed Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the United States, has previously spoken about what he describes as his “terrible” voice, a condition known as spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nRFK Jr.'s first noticed a change in his voice at the age of 42\n\nEarlier this year, the 70-year-old Health Secretary told the Los Angeles Times that he “can’t stand” the sound of his voice. “My voice doesn’t really get tired,” the 70-year-old continued, “But the injury is neurological, so actually, the more I use the voice, the stronger it tends to get.” He added, “If I could sound better, I would.”\n\nKennedy revealed to the paper that he first noticed a change in his voice in 1996, at the age of 42. While he acknowledges there is no evidence linking the flu vaccine to his condition, he considers it “at least a potential culprit.”\n\nWhat is spasmodic dysphonia?\n\nSpasmodic dysphonia is also known by another name ​Laryngeal Dystonia, it is a condition where people with this condition suffer from voice and speech disorders.\n\nIn a publication released by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Alexander Hillel, M.D. states that spasmodic dysphonia “causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box or larynx. This causes the voice to break and have a tight, strained or strangled sound.”\n\nThere are three types of spasmodic dysphonia: adductor spasmodic dysphonia, abductor spasmodic dysphonia, and mixed spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hillel, spasmodic dysphonia is a lifelong condition and “most often affects women, with symptoms starting between the ages of 30 and 50.”\n\nWhat are the causes of spasmodic dysphonia?",

The main motive for celebrating Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month is to spread awareness to the public and also support those affected by pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhat is the pancreas?\n\nJust like any other organ in your body, the pancreas is also an organ that sits behind your stomach, just near your small intestine. According to reports, this pancreas releases enzymes to help a person digest food while regulating your body to manage glucose.\n\n<i>(Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. Rep Pic. Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nWhat are the signs I must know if my pancreas is in trouble?\n\nThe symptoms of pancreatic cancer may vary from person to person. However, here are some common signs of a person whose pancreas might be in trouble according to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\n\nAbdominal bloating: This condition is also known as Ascites, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen which causes the belly to become swollen and distended.\n\nUnexplained weight loss: If you have noticed someone who has lost appetite and desire for certain food while experiencing unexplained weight loss, it could be a sign of cancer cachexia.\n\nJaundice: Is your skin or eyes turning into yellowish colour? this condition is called jaundice which is caused by “excess bilirubin - a component of bile - in the blood.\" explains Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. “A tumor in the head of the pancreas can cause narrowing of the bile duct and block the bile flowing from the gallbladder into the small intestine. Blockage of the bile duct causes a buildup of bilirubin.\"",

No collateral, no third-party guarantee. The government gives you the guarantee for up to 100 crores.”\n\nShe added that the banks will develop a new credit assessment model which will help the MSMEs. \"Now we have announced in this budget that banks will do the credit assessment within themselves.

		"text": "SECI on Reliance Power: The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has issued a notice ordering a three-year ban on Anil Ambani’s Reliance Power, barring the company from any future tenders issued by the SECI.\n\n“Reliance NU BESS Limited, and M/s Reliance Power Limited (including its subsidiaries) stand debarred from participating in all the future tenders issued by SECI until 3 years from the date of issuance of the debarment notice,” said SECI in the official notification.\n\nWhy Ambani’s Reliance Power was banned?\n\nIn June, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) invited bids for a 1-gigawatt solar power project and a 2-gigawatt standalone battery energy storage system. However, the bidding process was cancelled at an advanced stage due to irregularities found in the bid submitted by Reliance NU BESS Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Power.\n\nDuring the bidding, Reliance NU BESS Ltd submitted a foreign bank guarantee accompanied by an email purportedly from the State Bank of India ( SBI ) in support. However, SECI’s investigation revealed that SBI had not issued any such endorsement and that the email was sent from a fraudulent address.\n\n“Based on the examination of documents submitted by Reliance NU BESS Limited, it was discovered that the endorsement of the Bank Guarantee against EMD (issued by a foreign Bank), as submitted by the company, was fake,” the SECI notification stated.",

		"text": "Trump trade drive Bitcoin: Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has surged to a record high during the Asian trading hours as investors anticipate Donald Trump winning the US presidential election.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the king crypto has surged more than 10 per cent breaching past the 75,200 mark. Other key cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB, XRP, and Dogecoin have recorded drastic jump. While Musk’s favourite crypto token Dogecoin has surged 25 per cent in the last 24 hours, Uniswap has recorded a nearly 36 per cent rise in its market value.\n\nTrump, noted for his vocal support for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, is likely to return to the White House with a softer take on crypto regulations. As of 10:08 am, 230 electoral votes had gone to Republican candidate Trump and 205 to Democratic Party's Harris, according to reports from the Associated Press.\n\n“Bitcoin, ether and Dogecoin have all rallied in a sign crypto traders are positioning for a Trump victory. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, touched a fresh record in Asian trading on Wednesday. Dogecoin is up around 20 per cent, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also jumped around 7 per cent,” said ace investor Ajay Bagga.\n\n“Trump has emerged as a supporter of cryptocurrency, as has JD Vance, his running mate on the Republican ticket,” Bagga added.\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin said that the investors will take the US election results as a strong cue and that crypto markets will reflect a direct impact from the results.\n\n“The positive sentiment surrounding Trump's potential return has boosted Bitcoin and positively impacted the broader cryptocurrency market, with other digital assets like Ether and Dogecoin experiencing notable gains. Continued political developments and regulatory discussions will likely influence market dynamics as investor enthusiasm remains high.”\n\nOn platforms like Polymarket, bets on Trump’s victory have surged to 90 per cent, despite the discrepancy with traditional polling data.\n\nTalking about the rise in decentralised markets, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research shares that Trump’s win can take Bitcoin prices to new heights. Lee said, “If Trump were to win, BTC could continue driving the market higher without major pullbacks, potentially reaching even greater highs. In contrast, a Harris victory might lead to a short-term BTC correction, but long-term growth would still be anticipated, possibly achieving new records over time.”",

		"title": "US Stock Market: Wall Street Ticks Higher on Election Day",
		"text": "New York: US stock indexes are ticking higher Tuesday as voters head to the polls on the last day of the presidential election.\n\nUS Stock Market\n\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent in early trading, inching closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 66 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 9.35 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6 per cent higher.\n\nExcitement about the artificial-intelligence boom helped lift Wall Street, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 16.7 per cent after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter.\n\nIt's an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, “We absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won't slow down.” Boeing was edging up by 0.1 per cent after its factory workers who had been on strike voted to accept the aerospace giant's latest contract offer. The ratification clears the way for Boeing to restart Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the walkout idled for 53 days and resume production of its bestselling airliner.\n\nThey helped offset a 5.2 per cent drop for Wynn Resorts after the casino operator's results for the latest quarter fell short of analysts' forecasts.\n\nThe main event, though, is the election, even if the result may not be known for days, weeks or months as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.\n\nDespite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term and what corporate profits will do over the next few years and a decade. Stocks have historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has risen in 73 per cent of the years where a Democrat was president and 70 per cent of the years when a Republican was the nation's chief executive, from 1945 through late last month, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n\nThe US stock market has tended to rise more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush's term hurt the Republican's average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.\n\nBesides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.\n\nThe general hope among investors is often for split control of the US government because that's more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation's debt much, much higher.\n\nAs for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedence to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5 per cent in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.\n\nFour years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn't clear yet. And it kept going higher even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.31 per cent from 4.29 per cent late Monday.",

The attacker volleyed it into the top left corner to double his side’s lead.\n\nNorthEast United's march was halted with Dinesh receiving his second yellow card of the match just as the first half whistle was about to be blown.\n\nWith one man less at his disposal, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali took a more strategic approach in the final 45 minutes -- limiting the opposition’s flow of attacks, taking their time in building up play, and not losing possession easily.",

		"text": "India's Yashasvi Jaiswal runs between the wickets on the second day of the first cricket test between Australia and India in Perth, Australia | Image: AP Photo\n\nThe seeds of success are sown in thorough preparation and Yashasvi Jaiswal's intense and innovative pre-tour training against short-pitched balls at the Thane Stadium contributed to his unbeaten 90 on the second day of the opening Test against Australia.\n\nRahul Dravid's hours of training at the National Cricket Academy ahead of the 2011 tour of England or Sachin Tendulkar creating rough outside the leg-stump and asking Laxman Sivaramakrishnan to simulate Shane Warne's leg-breaks have found place in Indian cricketing folklore.\n\nJaiswal, the next batting superstar in waiting, too is meticulous about his training methods, most of which he has developed under Rajasthan Royals' Director of Cricket Zubin Bharucha at their academy in Maharashtra's Talegaon, where he has trained since lockdown.\n\nHowever, due to a short gap between the New Zealand series and the flight to Australia, Jaiswal had to make a quick mental and technical switch-over from the rank turners at home to counter the steep bounce which he would encounter Down Under, especially at the opening game in Perth.\n\nFor a couple of days from morning till late evening, Jaiswal was stationed at the Thane stadium near his home, roughly facing 200 overs of throw-downs with a concrete slab positioned on an inclined plane (45 degree angle) at short of length (around the 10 metre area).\n\nThere Jaiswal was fed with throw-downs using orange and yellow coloured balls which were aimed at his rib cage and outside the off-stump around 145 clicks.\n\n\"The time was less so he practised at the Thane Stadium. The balls that were used were lighter in nature and hence travelled quicker through the air. The concrete slab was kept at short of length and he faced roughly around 200 overs across two days before he left for Australia,\" Bharucha, who is currently in Jeddah for the IPL auctions, shared with PTI.\n\nSo, how does one manage to play 100 overs in a day? \"The rotational speed per ball is rapid, i.e. it's just ball after ball without any break. So, we can get through this easily in 2.5 hours with just a couple of breaks,\" the former Mumbai opener offered an insight.\n\nIn earlier days before a tour to Australia or South Africa, the standard mode was to get throw-downs on cement wickets from 15 yards with wet tennis balls. But just like cricket has changed over the years, the method of coaching has also changed.\n\n\"Bounce is something that cannot always be simulated on turf pitches like rough that Sachin Tendulkar created for simulation. Hence concrete slab kept at an inclined plane creates that skiddy uncomfortable bounce. Also the synthetic balls that are used are a bit softer.\n\n\"It looks like hockey balls but is way lighter and hence travels quicker. Obviously, you can't create seam movement simulation but nevertheless it is a very good mode of practice,\" a former first-class cricketer, who has also worked as a coach at the NCA, explained.\n\nThis is a mode of training that even India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar uses for his wards like KKR's Angkrish Raghuvanshi.",

		"text": "The dilemma over the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025 continues as the suspense over the tournament's official schedule remains. India continues to hold the stance that the team isn't travelling to Pakistan over security issues, while the PCB remains steadfast that the tournament will be solely hosted in Pakistan and no hybrid mode will be followed. The ICC remains in turmoil over the situation as the two cricket giants remain at an impasse. Recently, speculations were rife that the ICC had sat down with the BCCI and PCB in a virtual meeting, but the Pakistan Cricket Board has offered a contradictory statement.\n\nPCB Dismisses Rumors Of Engaging In Talks With BCCI, ICC Over Champions Trophy 2025\n\nIn an attempt to clear up the confusion surrounding the Champions Trophy, the Pakistan Cricket Board dismissed reports on Saturday that its representatives would be meeting virtually with their counterparts at the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on November 26.\n\n“We have no information from the ICC about any meeting between us, BCCI and ICC,” a reliable PCB source told PTI in conditions of anonymity. The sources also stated that the PCB has yet to receive a response from the ICC about the email it sent to the world body enquiring about India's reluctance to deploy the team to the neighbouring country.\n\nHowever, an ICC source stated that an internal meeting on Tuesday might be held to resolve the thorny matter. He explained that the meeting was convened because the event's broadcaster has been placing a lot of pressure on the ICC to settle the schedule.\n\n“It is a virtual meeting of the Executive Board members to resolve the issue of the Champions Trophy schedule once for all. There is a chance that there could be a vote on what to do and whether the event should be held — in Pakistan, relocate it or adopt the Hybrid Model as suggested by the BCCI with India playing its matches in the UAE,\" the source said.",

		"title": "Indiana Pacers Tyrese Haliburton struggling early in their follow-up to breakthrough season",
		"text": "If the first half of last season served as a coming-out party for Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers, the early part of this one is underscoring the challenges of sustaining that level of success.\n\nIndiana (6-10) has lost three straight and five of its last six after falling 129-117 to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday. The Pacers are 0-2 in the NBA Cup after finishing second in this event last year, when it was known as the In-Season Tournament.\n\nOne reason for the drop-off is a slow start from Haliburton, who was part of the U.S. Olympic gold medal-winning team over the summer after earning third-team All-NBA honors last season while helping the Pacers make a surprising run into the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nHaliburton is shooting just 37.8% overall and 29.4% from 3-point range, down from 47.7% overall and 36.4% from beyond the arc last season. His scoring average has dropped from 20.1 last season to 15.5 this year. He has 8.5 assists per game after averaging a league-high 10.9 in 2023-24.\n\n“I’ve got to be better,” Haliburton said.\n\nThis tournament represented a showcase for Haliburton a year ago, as he even mimicked Milwaukee star Damian Lillard’s “Dame Time” celebration by pointing to his wrist while making a 3-pointer during a 27-point, 15-assist performance in a semifinal victory over the Bucks .\n\nHaliburton now finds himself searching for answers. Although Haliburton had 18 points and nine assists Friday, he dismissed the notion this game represented a step forward for him. Much of his production came late in the game as the Pacers were trying to come back.\n\n“I’ve just got to keep trusting myself, working hard, trusting my teammates,” Haliburton said. “I’ll figure it out.”\n\nFriday’s performance followed a five-game stretch in which Haliburton shot 30.3% (20 of 66) overall. Haliburton was asked after the game if he has gained a better sense of what’s been holding him back lately.\n\n“No, I don’t,” he replied.\n\nThe Pacers’ issues go beyond Haliburton’s struggles. Multiple injuries have set them back, as Aaron Nesmith has missed the last three weeks with a sprained ankle and Andrew Nembhard last played Nov. 6 due to a knee issue.\n\nPacers forward Pascal Siakam refused to use those injuries to explain away Indiana’s tough start.\n\nThis is the NBA, man,” said Siakam, who had 25 points Friday. “It happens to everyone. You can’t use it as an excuse.”\n\nIndiana coach Rick Carlisle saw some encouraging signs in the way the Pacers performed Friday, even though they never led.\n\nThe Pacers trailed by as many as 25 in the third quarter and were still down 20 with less than 10 minutes left, but they cut the deficit to six midway through the final period.\n\n“It’s something to build on, as tough as it’s been,” Carlisle said.\n\nCarlisle said the Pacers seemed more connected at times Friday. He said that’s been an issue in other games this year, noting how issues on one end of the floor would hamper them on the other end as well.\n\n“We got together yesterday and talked about it in pretty great detail and had some real honest talk about it,” Carlisle said. “We did a lot of listening to the players. They did a lot of talking to themselves about it.”\n\nThe benefits of that conversation were evident in Indiana’s second-half comeback Friday, but the Pacers ultimately fell short again to cap an 0-3 road trip. They return home for their next four games as they hope to continue improving their habits and start collecting some wins.\n\nThey only need to look at Friday’s opponent to see how fast teams can turn their fortunes around in the Eastern Conference. The Bucks lost eight of their first 10 games. They’ve won five of six since and suddenly are up to sixth place in the East.\n\n“Right now, it can’t just be about the ball and who’s touching it and who’s getting shots,” Carlisle said. “It’s got to be about the entire team. It’s got to be about the challenges that we’re up against and what we’re representing.",

The second innings for Team India appeared to be a stroll in the park for Yashasvi, who engaged in light-hearted banter with Australian paceman Mitchell Starc.\n\nBanter Between Yashasvi Jaiswal And Mitchell Starc Ensues As India Stand Resilient vs AUS\n\nDuring Team India's second innings at the Optus Stadium in Perth, Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul were on guard as they held their stance against the Aussie attack. During the play, Jaiswal faced off against Starc's deliveries, and he hit them with the bat with ease. He even sent one of his deliveries to the skies for a six.\n\nAt one point, Yashasvi Jaiswal was playing with Mitchell Starc's mind as he engaged in a frivolous banter to derail the bowler's momentum. After playing a shot, he said, \"It's coming too slow\" to Starc, who was staring at him after the delivery.\n\nSpeaking of the game, Yashasvi Jaiswal and veteran KL Rahul chose to stick to the tried-and-true method of batting in Test cricket by waiting for loose deliveries and respecting good fast bowling after captain Jasprit Bumrah's game-changing 11th five-wicket haul destroyed Australia for 104.\n\nOn the second day of the first Test match at the Optus Stadium in Perth, India appeared destined to bat Australia out of the match with an overall lead of 218 runs thanks to a combination of game awareness and flawless shot selection from Yashasvi Jaiswal and an unbroken opening stand of 172 from KL Rahul. During the post-tea session, the Indian batters demonstrated their compact defence by amassing 88 runs in 31 overs, with Jaiswal edging closer to the coveted century on his maiden appearance on Australian tracks.",

They led 51-29 at the break, having turned the ball over just three times.\n\nDerrick Jones Jr. added 17 for Los Angeles, which is 1-1 in the NBA Cup and has won seven straight home games after dropping its first four at the new Intuit Dome.\n\nDe’Aaron Fox had 25 of his 29 points in the second half for the Kings, who put up a fight but couldn't overcome their early struggles.

This functional trend became a staple for fashion lovers in India.\n\nHeavy T-Shirts: With a fabric weight exceeding 200 grams per square meter (GSM), heavy t-shirts dominated the streetwear scene.

		"text": "New York: A piece of conceptual art consisting of a banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday.\n\n“Comedian,” by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it.\n\nThe piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view, but three editions sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.\n\nFive years later, someone has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, they have purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives them the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it “Comedian.”\n\nBidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, as the auctioneer joked, “It’s slipping through the auction room.” The final hammer price announced in the room was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.",

These moments were seen often after her separation from Prince Charles.\n\nPrincess Diana's fashion-forward moment. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nPrincess Diana's blast-from-the-past viral moment\n\nThe moment happened during the royal tour of Australia in 1985. Diana had spent the day in the blazing sun and ended up with a sunburn on her neck. But that wasn’t going to stop her from rocking a spectacular emerald and diamond necklace—a wedding gift from Queen Elizabeth—for a gala dinner at the Southern Cross Hotel.\n\nRichard Dalton, Diana's hairdresser at the time, couldn’t help but admire the beauty of the necklace. Inspiration struck, and he came up with a bold idea: why not transform the necklace into a headband? Dalton recalled the moment in his book It’s All About the Hair: My Decade with Diana. He enlisted Evelyn, Diana's dresser, and they got creative, using knicker elastic (yes, the kind grandmothers wear) to secure the necklace around Diana’s forehead.\n\nThe result? A glamorous, edgy look that had everyone buzzing. Dalton tied the elastic behind her head, tucked Diana’s hair around it, and—voilà—she had a head-turning accessory that turned heads all night long. Diana was delighted with the result, and Dalton later joked that he never traveled without knicker elastic again.",

		"text": "In the Name of Open Economy, We Gave Unfair Advantages to Others: EAM Jaishankar | Image: ANI\n\nBengaluru: In the name of open economy, we allowed other countries to get an advantageous playing field in the country and this has to stop, said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday.\n\nJaishankar was delivering a virtual keynote address at the 8th India Idea Conclave at Bengaluru. This year, the conclave, organised by India Foundation, is exploring the theme, ‘building Brand Bharath’.\n\n“In the name of globalisation, we actually hollowed out the manufacturing. SMEs have been hurting for the last 30 years because they see unfair competition, see subsidised goods coming into the country. If we cannot protect them, they cannot compete,” he said.\n\nAccording to Jaishankar, under Modi’s ‘Brand Bharath’, this is being done differently as 'Make in India' has moved from aspiration to an assertion.\n\n“Look at semi conductors industry. We understand today semi conductor will be a make or break for a country like India,” he said, adding that where India that is Bharath is doing things differently is in taking the hard calls were necessary.\n\nOne such call is being prudent on foreign direct investments (FDI), said Jaishankar.\n\n“I can tell you, in every FDI negotiation, we think very long, very hard. We are very concerned both about the social fabric and employment consequences of an FDI, as well as its national security implications,” the Minister said.\n\nHe added that the Modi government will never sign an FDI if these are not addressed.\n\n“And I think that is the departure from the past,” he said.\n\nThe minister also said since PM Modi took over, if he has to pick a region where India has really built a Brand Bharath, it would be the Middle East.\n\nAccording to him, traditional belief is that if a country does well with Israel, it will lose all other players in the region. But he pointed out that India has proved this conventional wisdom wrong in the last 10 years.\n\n“Today, Brand Bharath is seen as an ambitious brand. We are not just one among many willing to go with the flow. We will take the hard calls, put in resources, and we will stay in touch with the contemporary world... Under PM Modi, that really has been the big change, which is why our brand is different,” said Jaishankar.",

		"title": "3 Reasons Behind Mahayuti’s Record Breaking Victory In Maharashtra Assembly Elections",
		"text": "The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged victorious in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, showcasing a meticulously crafted strategy. From a strong Hindu consolidation campaign to welfare-driven policies, here’s a breakdown of three key reasons for their success.\n\nThe BJP stayed consistent with its winning formula, the same approach that secured its victory in Haryana just a month earlier. By adhering firmly to its strategy, honed over the last few elections, the party has showcased a remarkable streak of success. Consecutive triumphs in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana, and now Maharashtra have left political experts analysing the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nHindu Vote Consolidation: “Batenge to katenge” Resonates Again\n\nThe BJP leaned heavily on the \"Batenge to katenge\" slogan, coined by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, to consolidate Hindu votes. This slogan, later rephrased by PM Modi as “Ek hai toh safe hai”, found traction among urban and semi-urban voters, countering the minority consolidation favouring the INDIA bloc.\n\nSpecific instances like the BJP's losses in Dhule and Mumbai North East seats during earlier elections were used to emphasise the importance of Hindu unity. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) backed this campaign with grassroots outreach initiatives, using the slogans to bridge caste divisions and energise voters. Their campaign, “Sajag Raho” (‘Be Vigilant’), was designed not only to rally support for the BJP but also to counter perceived attempts to fragment the Hindu vote bank.\n\nLadki Bahin and Ladka Bhau Yojana\n\nThe BJP-led alliance embraced welfare schemes to woo voters. Learning from the effectiveness of schemes like the Ladli Behna initiative in Madhya Pradesh, the alliance expanded its offerings in Maharashtra.\n\nFinance Minister Ajit Pawar announced schemes like the Mukhyamantri Maajhi Ladki Bahin Yojana and Ladka Bhau Yojana, alongside promises of free LPG cylinders for the underprivileged. These initiatives, coupled with increased cash handouts under the Ladki Bahin scheme, helped the Mahayuti connect with economically disadvantaged voters, solidifying support among women and marginalised communities.\n\nRSS Support and Robust Election Machinery\n\nThe BJP showcased unparalleled synergy and organisational coordination during the campaign. Top leaders of the party, including PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, addressed numerous rallies, covering 144 constituencies between them. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari complemented this effort with a staggering 147 rallies combined. The party looked more active and covered the ground better than the others, and the strong support from the RSS worked in their way again.",

		"text": "Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar Election Results2024: All About Constituency, Key Candidates, Past Winners, and More | Image: Republic\n\nMankhurd Shivaji Nagar Election Results 2024: The Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar Assembly constituency is one of Maharashtra ’s 288 constituencies. It belongs to the Mumbai North East Lok Sabha constituency and has a unique mix of communities that make its elections interesting every time. The counting of votes in the Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar Assembly seat in Maharashtra concluded on Saturday, November 23.\n\nThe key contest in the Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar Assembly is between the sitting MLA from the Samajwadi Party (SP), Abu Asim Azmi against Nawab Malik from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).\n\nThis area has a population that is about 58% Muslim. The remaining 42% includes Marathis, North Indians, South Indians, and Dalits. This diverse population often leads to tough political contests.\n\nMankhurd Shivaji Nagar Election Results 2024: Here Are The Updates\n\n03:56 PM: The counting has completed and Abu Asim Azmi from SP has won the elections.\n\n11:47 AM: Abu Asim Azmi is leading with +5,202 votes. Ateeq Ahmad Khan from All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen is trailing.\n\n10.27 AM: Abu Asim Azmi from Samajawadi Party is leading by +86 votes.

Nawab Malik from NCP is trailing.\n\n08:00 AM: Counting of votes begins\n\n06:00 AM: Counting of votes to begin at 8 AM amid tight security.\n\nKey Candidates in the 2024 Polls:\n\nIn the 2024 election, Abu Asim Azmi, the sitting MLA from the Samajwadi Party (SP), is running for re-election. Azmi has held this seat for three terms and is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance.\n\nHe is facing tough competition from Suresh 'Bullet' Patil of the Shiv Sena, who represents the Mahayuti alliance.\n\nAnother major candidate is Nawab Malik from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Nawab Malik, a former minister in the MVA government, joined Ajit Pawar ’s NCP faction after the party split.\n\nHis candidacy has been controversial because he was arrested in 2022 in a case involving Dawood Ibrahim and associates.\n\nNawab Malik was released on bail in July 2023 on medical grounds, but the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has opposed his participation in the election.\n\nLook at The Past Winners:\n\nMankhurd Shivaji Nagar has been a stronghold for Abu Asim Azmi and the Samajwadi Party. Abu Asim Azmi first won this seat in 2009 and has held it ever since.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, he defeated Vithal Govind Lokare of the then-undivided Shiv Sena by a large margin of 25,601 votes.\n\nHis success in 2014 and 2009 also solidified his hold over the constituency, despite challenges from various parties like the Congress and independent candidates.\n\nPolling and Counting Date for Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar Constituency\n\nThe constituency went to the polls on November 20, 2024, along with the rest of Maharashtra.\n\nThe counting of votes will take place on November 23, and the results will reveal whether Azmi retains his seat or if a new leader emerges.\n\nAbout Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar\n\nThis constituency plays an important role in Mumbai’s political landscape. It has long been dominated by the Samajwadi Party candidate Abu Asim Azmi’s leadership and support from the area’s Muslim population.\n\nOver the years, candidates from Shiv Sena, Congress, and smaller parties have tried to challenge this dominance but have found it difficult to break through.\n\nWith its diverse population and history of intense political competition, Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar continues to be one of the most watched constituencies in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Maharashtra Election Result 2024 LIVE: Counting of Votes Begins | Republic World",

		"title": "Man of The Moment: How Fadnavis Scripted BJP’s Stunning Comeback in Maharashtra",
		"text": "Ladki Bahna Yojana—A Game Changer\n\nThe Maharashtra government's Ladki Bahna Yojana emerged as a cornerstone of its electoral success, securing widespread support from women voters across the state. The scheme, designed to provide financial aid to women, struck a chord across diverse demographics.\n\nHailing the scheme, Ajit Pawar said,“Ladki Bahin Yojana became our game changer. It defeated each of our adversaries. I have not seen such a victory in my memory. We will not be swayed away by the victory but this has increased our responsibility for sure. We have to behave responsibly now. Especially financial discipline is needed to fulfil all our promises. We are committed to that.\"\n\nLaunched on Raksha Bandhan (August 2024), the Ladki Bahin scheme offers ₹1,500 monthly to over one crore women in Maharashtra. Modeled after the 'Ladli Behna Yojana' by Shivraj Chouhan's Madhya Pradesh government, the Maharashtra government has pledged that the scheme will continue indefinitely.In an early trial run, more than 30 lakh eligible women received ₹3,000 directly into their bank accounts.\n\nDespite an estimated annual expenditure of ₹46,000 crore, the Ladki Bahna Yojana proved instrumental in winning the trust and loyalty of women voters, significantly influencing the election outcome.\n\nThe Role of RSS\n\nThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) played a pivotal role in empowering the BJP's electoral campaign, particularly in Haryana , where its cadre worked tirelessly to reach the grassroots. Their efforts ensured BJP's resonance among Hindu, non-Jat, and Dalit communities, giving the party a crucial edge.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the RSS adopted a similarly aggressive approach. After the BJP's underwhelming performance in the Lok Sabha elections in northern states, the Sangh redoubled its efforts to support the BJP's campaign. Reports, including one from The Indian Express, highlighted the RSS’s systematic door-to-door outreach, urging voters to back the Mahayuti alliance.\n\nSenior RSS officials credited the Sajag Raho campaign—a personalized voter engagement initiative—as a key factor in bridging caste divides and rallying Hindu voters under a united front.\n\nThe RSS’s active participation extended to other states, notably in Uttar Pradesh by-polls, where it played a decisive role in aiding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 's campaign. The Sangh even endorsed Adityanath’s slogan, \"Batenge toh katenge\", underlining its steadfast commitment to promoting Hindu solidarity.\n\nHindutva in Focus\n\nBoth the Maharashtra and Haryana elections witnessed a sharp focus on Hindutva as BJP leaders doubled down on polarizing narratives. Slogans like \"Batenge toh katenge\" and its toned-down counterpart, \"Ek hai toh safe hai\", struck a powerful chord with the BJP’s core supporters. These hardline messages effectively countered opposition efforts to consolidate votes from Muslim, Dalit, and Kunbi communities, solidifying BJP’s dominance in both states.\n\nStrategic OBC Outreach\n\nOBCs, comprising nearly 38% of Maharashtra's population, hold influence in around 175 of the 288 assembly seats. Recognizing this, BJP leaders, including Devendra Fadnavis, crafted a focused outreach strategy targeting this demographic. The party employed the \"MaDhVa\" formula—representing Mali (gardener), Dhangar (shepherd), and Vanjari communities—to strengthen its appeal, particularly following the divisive Maratha reservation agitation.\n\nCurrent trends indicate that this approach has paid off, with the BJP projected to win 17 seats in the Marathwada region alone.\n\nMahayuti Decimates MVA\n\nAfter defeating MVA, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said the results of the assembly elections were historic, and decided to whom the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena belong to.\n\nHolding a joint press conference as the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP coalition was poised to win a massive victory, the leaders of the Mahayuti assured that the next government will be formed smoothly.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the people rejected the politics of appeasement and responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's `Ek Hai toh Safe Hai' message of unity.\n\nNCP chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar averred that the ruling alliance will not get carried away by the landslide win, and will bring financial discipline.\n\nReferring to the poor showing of the rival factions, both Shinde and Ajit Pawar said the results showed to whom the Shiv Sena and NCP belong.\n\n\"After all the results are declared, our MLAs will come to Mumbai, and all three parties will elect their leaders,\" Fadnavis said.\n\nShinde pointed out that the three parties had finalised their seat-sharing amicably, and said the government formation process would not face any hinderance.\n\nThey learnt lessons from the Lok Sabha debacle and took corrective steps, Ajit Pawar added.",

		"text": "It is 3:30 PM right now and the results of Maharashtra Assembly Elections are clear. BJP+ has won by a landslide. As of now, BJP is leading in 132 seats, and its alliance partner Shiv Sena is leading in 54 seats. The total number of seats in Maharashtra Assembly elections is 288.\n\nThis is, by any measure, a landslide victory. This victory is even more significant because just a few months ago, during the 2024 Lok Sabha election, BJP performed rather poorly in Maharashtra. BJP and its alliance partners secured just 17 seats in the state, whereas Congress and its alliance partners secured 30 seats. BJP, on its own, won just 9 seats. BJP's surprising underperformance in Maharashtra and U.P. were the two main factors due to which BJP lost its majority.\n\nSo, in a few months, what changed?\n\nSimply put, the role played by RSS. In the Maharashtra Assembly elections, RSS played a crucial role in helping BJP+ win. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, RSS, largely, remained inactive. Why? It is hard to say, there is a lot of speculation. Although, one can safely assume that the BJP President's statement, in which he suggested BJP is self-sufficient now and doesn't need the Sangh's help, didn't go down well with numerous Swayamsevaks.\n\nBJP, after the surprising result of 2024 Lok Sabha elections, decided to course correct and reached out to the Sangh, which, after all, is BJP's ideological parent. Multiple reports state that Devendra Fadnavis, who himself is a Swayamsevak, reached out to the Sangh, along with other senior BJP leaders. Reports state that just weeks after the Lok Sabha elections, Fadnavis, along with other BJP leaders, met senior leaders of the Sangh at least 6 times, to create a plan for the assembly election.\n\nA RSS functionary who was reportedly present in one of the meetings, said to a leading Indian daily that \"We consider the Lok Sabha result a lesson for the BJP. The Nadda statement also hurt us and led to the Sangh keeping away from the elections. However the BJP and the Sangh have no options besides each other, yes we were upset but when your own makes a mistake you slap them once and work with them again.”\n\nOne factor that may have persuaded Sangh to play a role in this elections, is the Congress' attempt to increase the salience of caste amongst Hindus. RSS, since the time of its founding by K.B. Hedgewar, has considered caste based hierarchies immoral. RSS has, for decades, advocated that Dalits should become temple priests. In 2006, Pancajanya, Sangh's newspaper, stated in an editorial that “even God will desert the temple where Dalits can't enter”.\n\nAs India is urbanizing, the salience of caste is getting diluted and national identity, Hindu identity, is becoming more prominent. Sangh views this as a good trend. Congress' attempt to revive caste identity is a cause of concern amongst many Swayamsevaks. Some reports suggest that RSS felt compelled to take part in this election, because, Congress' attempt to resuscitate the cadaver of caste, alarmed them (the Sangh).\n\nA look at how RSS reached out to voters\n\nThe collaboration between the two organizations (Sangh and BJP) played a pivotal role in reversing the BJP’s fortunes, with the saffron party securing a decisive win in the state.\n\nStrategic Deployment and Grassroots Mobilization\n\nFacing challenges in several key constituencies, the RSS deployed its cadre to regions where the BJP was on the back foot. According to a BJP insider cited in an Indian daily, a mechanism was established for sharing inputs and implementing course-corrective measures based on RSS feedback.\n\nThe RSS’s strategy avoided high-profile public rallies or overt endorsements of BJP candidates. Instead, its Swayamsevaks focused on raising awareness about issues perceived as threats to Hindu unity. “The RSS in its characteristic style has activated its network to create awareness on crucial issues threatening the unity of Hindus. Our goal is to build a strong Hindu Rashtra that caters to the welfare of every individual, rising above caste, community, and religion,” said an RSS leader, to an Indian newspaper.\n\nE pluribus unum?\n\nThis emphasis on Hindu unity was evident in BJP’s campaign messaging. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan, “Ek hai toh safe hai” (Together, we are safe), was tailored to drill into the head of voters that caste divisions must be rejected. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath echoed the sentiment with his warning, “Batenge toh katenge”, urging voters to reject divisions along caste lines.\n\nCountering Opposition Consolidation\n\nThe BJP faced significant challenges from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, which had gained traction among Dalits and Muslims after its “Save the Constitution” campaign during the Lok Sabha polls. Additionally, Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil’s demands for community reservations further tested the ruling Mahayuti alliance.\n\nAn RSS leader highlighted the perceived dangers of caste and religious consolidation by opposition forces, stating to an Indian daily, “In the Lok Sabha polls, we saw how dangerously the consolidation of caste and religion took place, which was detrimental to society at large. Our role is to impress upon people the dangers of such divisions and to unite Hindus to defeat such designs.”\n\nVictory through Cohesion\n\nThe synergy between the RSS’s grassroots efforts and the BJP’s campaign strategy ultimately paid dividends. By emphasizing unity and addressing the concerns of various communities, the BJP was able to consolidate its support base. The result was a clear majority for the saffron alliance in Maharashtra, a much-needed victory after the Lok Sabha disappointment.",

		"text": "Maharashtra Election Results: The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance in Maharashtra has staged a resounding comeback, with the latest trends from the Election Commission showing it leading in 217 of the state’s 288 assembly seats. Mahayuti is all likely to retain power in the state, leaving the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) trailing far behind.\n\nThe victory marks a dramatic turnaround for the Mahayuti alliance, which only five months ago had faced a disappointing Lok Sabha election outcome, securing just 17 of the state’s 48 seats.\n\nThis time, the alliance deployed an aggressive campaign centered on welfare measures that appear to have resonated with voters, particularly women.\n\nLadki Behna Yojana: The Game-Changer?\n\nThe most important among the welfare schemes that have driven Mahayuti’s resurgence is the “Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana.”\n\nLaunched in June, the scheme aims to empower women economically by providing direct cash transfers of ₹1,500 per month to eligible women aged 21 to 65 years. The scheme covers married, widowed, divorced, abandoned, and destitute women from families earning less than ₹2.5 lakh annually, and even extends to one unmarried woman per household.\n\nThe Mahayuti alliance also promised to increase the monthly aid to ₹2,100 upon returning to office.\n\nThis promise, along with other schemes like free LPG cylinders and the Ladka Bhau Yojana, created a robust welfare narrative that seems to have secured the alliance a critical support base.\n\nPeople Have Responded to Our Work: CM Shinde\n\nChief Minister Eknath Shinde credited the election outcome to the welfare measures bought by his government. “I thank all my ladki bahins (dear sisters) and brothers in the state who voted in large numbers for us,” Shinde said while addressing reporters.\n\n“The voting trend is an endorsement of our work. Every section of society, particularly women, has responded positively to our efforts for development and welfare.”\n\n“This outcome increases our responsibility to serve the people better. The Ladki Bahin Yojana has shown that targeted welfare can make a real difference,” he added.\n\nMVA's Struggles to Counter Welfare Narrative",

		"title": "Eknath Shinde: The New Face of Maratha Politics, Displacing Sharad Pawar’s Legacy",
		"text": "In a historic political shift, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has emerged as the dominant force in Maratha politics, replacing the towering figure of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar . Shinde’s meteoric rise has been cemented by his party Shiv Sena’s remarkable performance in the recently concluded Maharashtra assembly elections, where his leadership and grassroots clout reshaped the political landscape.\n\nShinde’s emphatic win from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane was symbolic of his growing influence. Securing 1,59,060 votes and a commanding 78.4% vote share, he defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Kedar Dighe, nephew of his mentor Anand Dighe, by a margin of 1.2 lakh votes. This victory not only underscored Shinde’s dominance on his home turf but also marked a new chapter in Maharashtra’s political dynamics.\n\nPawar's influence declining?\n\nIn a state long dominated by the towering figure of Sharad Pawar, who held sway over the Maratha vote bank for decades, Shinde’s rise signals a generational shift. Pawar, known for his strategic acumen and ability to build coalitions, has seen his influence wane in recent years. The NCP’s performance in this election, where it struggled to retain its foothold, highlights the changing tide.\n\nShinde's rise to power\n\nShinde’s journey to power has been nothing short of dramatic. In 2022, he led a rebellion against then-Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, splitting the Shiv Sena—a party founded by Bal Thackeray—and aligning with the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) to form the government. The move triggered a bitter feud between the two factions, with Shinde’s camp eventually securing the Shiv Sena’s name and iconic ‘bow-and-arrow’ symbol.\n\nUnder Shinde’s leadership, the Shiv Sena achieved a spectacular electoral performance. The party won 57 seats, out of the 81 candidates it fielded. Meanwhile, the rival Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Uddhav Thackeray, managed just nine wins and was leading in 11 seats.\n\nHere is what you need to know\n\nThe BJP, Shinde’s ally in the Mahayuti coalition, emerged as the largest party with 133 seats, while the coalition as a whole secured a staggering 233 seats in the 288-member assembly. Shinde’s ability to secure significant representation for his faction within the alliance underscores his growing importance in state and coalition politics.\n\nPolitical analysts believe Shinde’s success lies in his appeal to the Maratha community, a politically influential group in Maharashtra. While Sharad Pawar once dominated this space, Shinde has capitalized on the changing aspirations of the electorate, blending his Maratha identity with the larger Hindu identity, to which Shinde is ideologically committed.\n\nShinde’s victory and the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition’s triumph also signal a shift in Maharashtra’s political narrative, with the traditional power structures being redefined. For decades, Sharad Pawar’s strategic maneuvering made him the face of Maratha politics, but Shinde’s rise suggests that the mantle may now rest with a new leader.",

		"text": "Ranchi: As the counting of votes is near the end for 81 Assembly seats of Jharkhand polls 2024, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led INDIA alliance, is all set to retain power against a formidable challenge from the BJP -led NDA . As per the latest data by the Election Commission, Hemant leads his home turf Barhait with a margin of over 26,000 votes, with BJP's Gamliyel Hembrom trailing.\n\nDefying the exit poll predictions, the JMM is on its way to form its government for the third consecutive term in the states after leading in nearly 50 seats, a little above the halfway mark. Meanwhile, this year's election will hold immense significance as for the first time in the state's political history a Chief Minister will be elected for the second consecutive time.\n\nThe EC's latest data as of 5:20 pm showed a JMM-led alliance Mahagathbandhan with 57 seats (JMM-34, Congress - 17, RJD- 4 and CPI (ML) (L) 2). While the BJP-led NDA is trailing on 24 seats only.\n\nHemant Soren's Triumph\n\nThe recent historic win of JMM appears to be a public response to the Enforcement Directorate's action against Hemant Soren. In 2019, the JMM won only 13 of 38 seats while the BJP bagged 12 and Congress 8.\n\nWorry mounted JMM after Soren had to resign as the CM of the state ahead of his arrest by the ED in a money laundering case in January this year. However, senior leader Champai Soren took the helm of the state. However, soon after being granted bail by the High Court, Hemant was sworn in as the CM for the third time.\n\nFollowing this, Champai Soren left the party which was eventually seen as a major poll plank by the BJP, with leaders highlighting how a tribal leader was insulted by the JMM.\n\nHemant Soren's Comeback\n\nIn the 2024 polls, the BJP held several big including Prime Minister Narendra Modi , and Amit Shah who highlighted \"illegal immigration\" from Bangladesh as the main factor in the state. Furthermore, the party said that Jharkhand's 'maati, beti and roti' (land, daughter and bread) were in peril because \"infiltrators\" were grabbing the jal, zameen and jungle from the tribals.",

		"text": "Election Results 2024: Assembly elections results in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Assam and West Bengal have been declared and once again its not a favourable outcome for the Congress party.\n\nThe Mahayuti's Tsunami in Maharashtra completely wiped out the Congress-led Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance and restricted it to just 45 seats. While Maharashtra saw a complete rout of the MVA, Jharkhand has come out as a breather for the INDIA bloc particularly to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) but not so for the Congress.\n\nBuilding upon the momentum it gained in Lok Sabha polls, Congress under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, once again failed to impress the voters in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Assam and even Jharkhand.\n\nRahul Gandhi lead's Congress' catastrophe in elections, but how?\n\nMaharashtra results 2024\n\nCongress contested on a total of 101 seats in Maharashtra but managed to win just 15 seats. In 2019 elections, it won 44 seats. So from 44, the Congress came down to 15, given that they contested on more seats this time then the last election.\n\nJharkhand results 2024\n\nCongress contested on 30 seats and managed to win just 16. However, the INIDA bloc won the state with 56 seats comprising JMM, Congress, RJD and CPI (ML) (L). In 2019 also, the Congress won 16 seats only. So after 5 years, its growth remained stagnant.\n\nBypoll results\n\nThe Congress contested bypolls on 33 out of 48 seats but won only 7 of them. Out of these 7 seats, the Congress won 3 in Karnataka, two in Kerala – one each in Assembly and Parliamentary constituency, one each in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.\n\nOverall, the Congress party contested on a total of 164 seats but registered victory in just 38 of them. The only face-saver for the Congress is Karnataka, where it managed a 100 per cent strike rate. The Grand Old Party conducted 3 seats and won all of them.\n\nIn a slight comparison, since 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 549 seats went for elections out of which BJP won 231 while Congress just managed to win 75 of them.\n\nSo, for the Congress party winning just 38 out of the 164 seats is a performance which it seriously needs to introspect.\n\nRahul welomes Jharkhand results, calls Maharashtra unexpected\n\nRahul Gandhi said that the INDIA bloc's victory in the Jharkhand Assembly polls is a one for the protection of the Constitution as well as of water, forest and land, even as he described the Maharashtra poll results as \"unexpected\" and said his party will analyse the election outcome in the state in detail.\n\nIn a post in Hindi on X, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha thanked the voters of Jharkhand as well as those who voted for the INDIA opposition bloc in Maharashtra.\n\n\"Heartfelt thanks to the people of Jharkhand for giving a huge mandate to INDIA. Hearty congratulations and best wishes to Chief Minister Hemant Sorenji, all the workers of the Congress and the JMM for this victory.\n\n\"This victory of the alliance in the state is a victory for the protection of water, forest and land, along with that of the Constitution,\" he said.\n\n\"The results of Maharashtra are unexpected and we will analyse those in detail,\" Gandhi said as he thanked the voters of the state for their support and all the party workers for their hard work.\n\nThe former Congress chief also lauded Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her victory on her poll debut from Kerala's Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency and said she will transform Wayanad into a beacon of progress with her dedication.\n\n\"I feel immense pride as my family in Wayanad has placed its trust in Priyanka. I know she will lead with courage, compassion and unwavering dedication to transform our cherished Wayanad into a beacon of progress and prosperity,\" he said in another post on X.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi won the Wayanad Lok Sabha bypoll with a huge margin on Saturday. The seat was vacated by Rahul Gandhi after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from both Rae Bareli and Wayanad in the parliamentary polls held in April-May.",

		"text": "New Delhi: After Mahayuti's massive victory in the Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' 2019 speech in the state Assembly has gone viral on social media wherein he had promised he would be back. \"Mera paani utarta dekh mere kinare par ghar mat basa lena, main samandar hoon lautkar wapas aaunga (Seeing my water recede, do not build a house on my shores, I am the sea and will come back),\" Fadnavis had said in the Maharashtra Assembly 5 years back in December 2019. And on November 24, 2024, Maharashtra Election Results showed that he is back yet again.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared the clip and showered praise on Devendra Fadnavis for the resounding victory. “Devendra fadnavis said main samandar hu laut ke aaunga and today he will prove it. Very happy for this man. Those who deserve will get it\", said a social media user, terming his win a 'great comeback'.\n\nAnother wrote, “Devendra Fadnavis is back with a big bang! Mera Paani utarta dekh, mere kinare par ghar mat basa lena, Mai Samandar hoon laut kar wapis aaunga.”\n\n‘Victory of Unity’\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to reporters after the victory, Fadnavis called it the victory of unity. “The people of Maharashtra have given us an unprecedented victory. This shows that people are with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In line with the slogan he gave 'Ek hain toh safe hain', people from all sections and communities voted for us unitedly... This is the victory of Mahayuti, CM Eknath Shinde, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and Ramdas Athawale, this is the victory of unity”, said Fandvis.\n\nWhen asked who will be the next CM of Maharashtra, the Deputy CM said, \"There will be no dispute on the CM's face.

Together with its partners Shiv Sena and NCP, the ruling Mahayuti alliance could win 219 of the 288 seats in the state, leaving the Congress-Shiv Sena(UBT)-NCP(SP) tie-up with just 51 seats.\n\nIn the ruling Mahayuti alliance, the BJP contested 149 assembly seats, the Shiv Sena 81 seats, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP in 59 constituencies.

		"text": "Maharashtra Election Results 2024: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )-led Mahayuti alliance made a resounding comeback in Maharashtra , with trends showing its dominance in 236 of the state’s 288 assembly seats as of 6:57 PM, leaving the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) far behind.\n\nMaha Vikas Aghadi's looming defeat in Maharashtra is a crushing blow for Uddhav Thackeray. In just three years, the former Chief Minister has lost not only power but also his grip on the Shiv Sena and the legacy of his father, Balasaheb Thackeray. Eknath Shinde 's rebel faction, which accused Uddhav of abandoning his father’s principles for political gain, turned the election into a battle of \"Who is the real Shiv Sena?\" With the results in, Shinde’s camp is quick to declare this an ideological triumph. Let's have a look at 5 possible reasons why Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership faltered.\n\n1. Shift from Balasaheb’s Hindutva Ideology\n\nBalasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena was built on Hindutva and Marathi pride. Under Uddhav, however, the alliance with Congress and NCP alienated core supporters. This ideological drift allowed the BJP, under Devendra Fadnavis and Eknath Shinde, to consolidate the Hindutva voter base. Raj Thackeray ’s MNS also criticized Uddhav for straying from Balasaheb’s vision, weakening his credibility further.\n\nFor example, the BJP said that the party is determined to amend the Waqf Act, regardless of stiff political opposition. \"In Karnataka, an entire village received a notice from the Waqf board claiming ownership of land. Don't you all agree the Waqf Act should be amended,\" Union Home Minister Amit Shah asked the crowd at Hingoli. After a resounding ‘yes' from gathering, Shah said “No matter how much Uddhavji and Sharad Pawar oppose it, Modiji will amend Waqf Act.”\n\n2. Perception of Appeasement Politics\n\nUddhav’s alleged focus on Muslim appeasement created discontent among traditional Shiv Sena voters. Shinde leveraged this narrative, with welfare schemes like the Ladki Behna Yojana and strong Hindutva messaging. Amit Shah further attacked Uddhav over policies favoring Muslims, including alleged opposition to renaming Aurangabad and Osmanabad. Taking Uddhav head-on at Yavatmal, Amit Shah had said “Uddhav babu, on one hand you did not visit Ram temple in Ayodhya and on the other hand you agreed to give Rs 1,000 crore to build mosques. Chullu bhar paani mein doob maro, doob maro (you should die of shame). I want to say to Rahul Gandhi , Sharad Pawar and Uddhav, that no matter how hard you try, we won't allow reservations for Muslims in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maharashtra.”\n\nShah alleged state Congress president Nana Patole recently met Muslim leaders and agreed to their multiple demands in lieu of votes for MVA. Shah also lambasted Thackeray for his party's alleged opposition to renaming Aurangabad and Osmanabad, stating, \"The real Shiv Sena is with BJP now. Your party is only UBT Sena.\"\n\n3. 2020 Palghar Sadhus Lynching Case\n\nUddhav faced criticism for allegedly halting the probe into the 2020 Palghar Sadhus lynching case, under Congress pressure. This delay damaged his image as a Hindutva leader. Additionally, his opposition to Dharavi’s redevelopment, seen as anti-development by many, worked against him.\n\nShiv Sena secretary and spokesperson Kiran Pawaskar alleged that Uddhav Thackeray had asked all the party leaders to refrain from speaking on the matter as it is a \"sensitive issue\". \"In a meeting, Uddhav Thackeray said that this Palghar issue is very sensitive and no one (Ministers or leaders) would talk about this outside. The order was given to stay mum. What was the secret behind it? The secret was that Uddhav Thackeray received a call from Rahul Gandhi,\" said Pawaskar.\n\nThe probe was however later handed over to the CBI, Shiv Sena alleged that delay in handover damaged the probe. CM Eknath Shinde in January this year, handed over cheques of Rs 5 lakh each to kin of three persons. Shinde said his Shiv Sena has now given them assistance from its own funds. Attacking Thackeray, Shinde said that then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has never bothered to meet the kin of these three persons.\n\n4. Uddhav’s CEO-style Leadership\n\nUddhav’s CEO-style leadership alienated grassroots workers, as he was seen as unapproachable. Leaders like Eknath Shinde and BJP’s Fadnavis capitalized on this disconnect by maintaining strong voter outreach and organizational unity. Even Shiv Sena veterans criticized Uddhav’s lack of communication and decision-making.\n\nShiv Sena veteran and Lok Sabha MP Gajanan Kirtikar, charged Uddhav Thackeray with failing to grow the party organisation and being surrounded by a coterie. “Uddhav ji’s lack of communication and inability to handle any situation with due diligence has damaged the party badly. I have closely experienced this divergence in the styles of functioning of Balasaheb (late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray) and Uddhav ji. In Uddhav ji’s entire tenure, I have rarely sensed any streamlined [manner of] communication by him,” wrote Kirtikar in his recently-published memoirs Shiv Sena, Lokadhikar Aani Mee (The Shiv Sena, the Lokadhikar Samiti and I).\n\n5. Uddhav Thackeray's Opposing Dharavi Redevelopment\n\nUddhav Thackeray said his party would oppose transforming Mumbai into \"Adani City.\" He criticised Gautam Adani's award of the Dharavi redevelopment tender as potentially problematic and called for its cancellation.",

Axis My India's survey was the only one which bucked the trend as most exit polls predicted a victory for the NDA in Jharkhand also.\n\nSpeaking to Republic Media Network's Arnab Goswami, Pradeep Gupta said that face to face interviews with the representatives across the demography and geography of the states and doing analysis on whatever they said. We put our weight on different factors including socio economic and released numbers at the time of the exit poll.\n\nIn both Maharashtra and Jharkhand elections, there was a pro-incumbency. We couldn’t find much people saying that they were discontent or angry with the incumbent leadership, Pradeep Gupta said adding if a government repeats, it only happens on one factor which is delivery, delivery and delivery on the basis of various social welfare schemes, facilities given to farmers, etc.\n\nFocussing on Maharashtra, Pradeep Gupta said that the Dalits and Adivasis (tribals) who shifted to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Lok Sabha came back to support Mahayuti alliance in Assembly elections. He said that 10 per cent of the Dalits, 15 per cent of tribals returned from MVA to Mahayuti.\n\nIn Maharashtra's Vidarbha region which has a total of 62 seats, the Mahayuti won 50 of them. Pradeep Gupta also mentioned that women voted more for Mahayuti than the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).\n\nIn Mumbai, where the polling increased from 50 in 2019 to 55 per cent in 2024, increased the size of the Mahayuti’s victory as we predicted 200 odd seats but it went upto 230.",

The by-poll results further solidify the TMC's political dominance throughout West Bengal.\n\nIn Haroa, where over 70 per cent of the electorate belongs to the minority community, the BJP came a distant third and failed to retain its deposit, prompting party leader Suvendu Adhikari to comment: “Minorities don’t vote for the BJP”.\n\nThe CPI(M)-led Left Front, which had hoped to capitalise on the RG Kar protests to revive its fortunes, faced a crushing defeat, losing its deposit in Sitai and Madarihat. Similarly, its ally, the CPI(ML), lost its deposit in Naihati, while the All India Secular Front (ISF) lost its deposit in Haroa.\n\nThe Congress, led by new state chief Suvankar Sarkar, contested without an alliance with the Left for the first time since 2021 but fared no better, losing deposits in all six constituencies.\n\nIn Sitai (SC), TMC’s Sangita Roy won by a margin of 1,30,636 over BJP’s Dipak Kumar Ray, who garnered only 35,348 votes. TMC’s vote share surged to 76 per cent, compared to 49 per cent in the 2021 state elections, while the BJP’s share plummeted from 45 per cent to just 16 per cent.\n\nBJP Loses Madarihat Seat To TMC\n\nThe Madarihat (ST) seat, previously held by the BJP, marked another significant victory for the TMC. The ruling party’s Jayprakash Toppo won with 79,186 votes, securing a lead of 28,168 votes over BJP’s Rahul Lohar.\n\nThis victory is historic for the TMC, as it marks the first time the party has taken control of Madarihat, a key seat in the tea garden belt, signaling a major political shift.\n\nThe TMC’s vote share surged to 54.05 per cent, while the BJP’s share dropped to 34 per cent, nearly mirroring TMC’s vote share of 34.13 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn Naihati, TMC’s Sanat Dey won with 78,772 votes, defeating BJP’s Rupak Mitra by 49,277 votes. TMC’s vote share increased to 62.97 per cent, up from 50 per cent in 2021, while BJP’s share fell to 23.58 per cent, a significant drop from 38 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn Haroa, TMC’s SK Rabiul Islam won with 1,57,072 votes, maintaining a commanding margin of 1,31,388 votes over Piyarul Islam of the ISF, who secured only 25,684 votes.\n\nThis result underscores TMC’s dominance among minorities in South Bengal. TMC's vote share surged to 76.63 per cent, while the ISF managed just 12.53 per cent, compared to 57.34 per cent for the TMC in 2021.\n\nIn Medinipur, TMC’s Sujoy Hazra won with 115,104 votes, a margin of 33,996 votes over BJP’s Subhajit Roy, who secured 81,108 votes.\n\nTMC’s vote share reached 53.43 per cent, compared to the BJP's 37.67 per cent, reflecting a similar outcome to 2021, when TMC had 50.72 per cent and the BJP had 40.51 per cent in this tribal-dominated seat.\n\nIn Taldangra, TMC’s Falguni Singhababu is leading with 54,327 votes, maintaining a margin of 20,273 votes over BJP’s Ananya Roy Chakraborty, who received 34,054 votes.\n\nTMC Chief Mamata Express Gratitude To Supporters\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee expressed her gratitude to the people of the state for their continued support, saying, “I would like to thank and congratulate the 'Maa, Mati, and Manush' from the bottom of my heart. Your blessings will help us work for the people in the coming days,” in a social media post.\n\nTMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee congratulated all six TMC candidates for their decisive victories, claiming they had “defied the narratives created by the Zamindars, the media, and a section of the Calcutta High Court to defame Bengal for their own vested interests.”\n\nHe also expressed special thanks to the people of Madarihat. \"I bow before the people of West Bengal for democratically dismantling the Bangla Birodhis, their fake narratives, and reaffirming their trust in us.\"\n\n‘Bypolls Not a Reliable Indicator’\n\nBJP state president Sukanta Majumdar downplayed the significance of the bypoll results. “Bypoll results cannot serve as a reliable indicator. Whether the people are with the TMC or against them will be reflected in the upcoming assembly elections,” Majumdar said.\n\nSetback For Congress-CPI(M)\n\nThe bypolls marked a significant setback for the CPI(M)-led Left Front and the Congress. The Left, accused by TMC of masterminding the prolonged doctor’s protests, failed to capitalise on the public anger surrounding the RG Kar incident, losing in all constituencies.\n\nSince the 2021 assembly elections, the TMC has won every by-election, except the Sagardighi bypoll in March 2023, which was later won by a Congress candidate who later switched to the TMC.\n\nWith this victory, TMC’s tally in the 294-member state assembly rises to 216, further consolidating its position. The BJP’s tally drops to 69, from 77 in 2021.",

Fielded by Chandrashekhar Azad's Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), Ajaz Khan of Bigg Boss 7 fame failed to translate his social media popularity - a staggering 5.6 million Instagram followers - into votes and was able to secure only 155 from the Versova constituency.\n\nFahad Ahmed (L) and Ajaz Khan suffered losses in Maharashtra assemble elections | Image: X\n\nIn another instance, Fahad Ahmed, the husband of actress Swara Bhaskar, trailed from the Anushakti Nagar constituency.

		"text": "Mumbai: Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday expressed concerns over the trends emerging from the counting of votes in Maharashtra for the recently held assembly elections, saying that they have done 'gadbad' to steal Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) seats. He said that such results are being imposed because this cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra.\n\nRaut further questioned the number of seats NCP and Shinde's Shiv Sena were getting, saying that the public doesn't agree with these results.\n\n\"They have done some 'gadbad', they have stolen some of our seats. This cannot be the public's decision. Even the public does not agree with these results. Once the results are out, we will talk more. In every election seat, money-counting machines were installed. Is it possible that Shinde will get 60 seats, Ajit Pawar will get 40 seats and BJP will get 125 seats? The people of this state are not dishonest. We have their faith in the people of Maharashtra,\" Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told mediapersons in Mumbai.\n\n\"Such a result has been imposed. This cannot be the decision of the people of Maharashtra. We know what the people of Maharashtra want in their hearts. This cannot happen. I would like to only say that this is not the decision of people,\" Raut added.\n\nThe senior Shiv Sena (UBT) leader lashed out at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Ajit Pawar saying that his party was getting more than 40 seats.\n\n\"What did they do that they are getting more than 120 seats?\" Raut asked.\n\nMeanwhile Senior Congress leader and former MP Udit Raj once again blamed EVMS for the poor showing, “As long as there are EVMs, elections cannot be fair. The election trends of Maharashtra clearly indicate that this is the victory of EVM.”\n\nThe complaints from the INDIA bloc comes after the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance crossed the halfway mark leading on 220 seats so far, while the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance is trailing with 52 seats as per trends by the Elections Commission of India at 11 am.\n\nAccording to initial trends, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena is leading in 55 seats, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 35, and the BJP has the most, leading in 128 seats, while the Rashtriya Yuva Swabhiman Party (RYSWP), which is part of the maha Yuti alliance has one seat.",

		"text": "Dehradun: The BJP retained the Kedarnath Assembly seat in Uttarakhand, with its candidate and state Mahila Morcha president Asha Nautiyal winning the bypolls by defeating Manoj Rawat of Congress with a margin of 5,622 votes.\n\nNautiyal took an early lead in the Uttarakhand election bypolls and maintained it throughout, securing her third victory from the Kedarnath seat. She was previously elected to the state Assembly from Kedarnath in 2002 and 2007.\n\nNautiyal received 23,814 votes, while Congress' Manoj Rawat secured 18,192 votes. Independent candidate Tribhuvan Singh came in third with 9,311 votes, according to the Election Commission website.\n\nReturning officer Anil Shukla handed the victory certificate to Nautiyal in Rudraprayag.\n\nIt is a significant victory for the ruling BJP as it would have been humiliating for the party to lose another pilgrimage seat in Uttarakhand after Badrinath.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the Congress has lost the seat. In the 2022 Assembly polls, Rawat finished third after BJP's Shaila Rani Rawat and Independent candidate Kuldeep Singh Rawat.\n\nThe bypoll was necessitated due to the death of BJP MLA Shaila Rani Rawat in July. Polling was held on November 20 and a voter turnout of 57.64 per cent was recorded.\n\nChief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said this is a \"huge victory\" for the BJP and the triumph of the development work carried out in Kedarnath under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"It is a victory of development, our policies and Sanatan. It is also a slap on the faces of those who spread all sorts of lies against the state government in the run-up to the bypoll,\" he said without naming anyone.\n\nDhami said his government is committed to taking development to the last person in Kedarnath.\n\nThe chief minister also staged a roadshow from Survey Chawk to the state BJP headquarters and thanked the party workers for the win in Kedarnath.\n\nAddressing the party workers, he gave the credit for the victory to Prime Minister Modi.\n\n\"I look upon it as a victory of Modi ji. After the 2013 disaster, development projects worth more than Rs 2,000 crore were begun in Kedarnath under our Prime Minister's leadership,\" he said.\n\nThe energy generated by this victory will be utilised to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Kedarnath, Dhami said.\n\nUttarakhand BJP president Mahendra Bhatt said, \"The voters of Kedarnath have once again rejected the negative politics of the Congress. I thank them for once again placing their trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and the BJP.\" He said the negative propaganda of the Congress which tried to spread misinformation about Kedarnath Dham had no impact on people who have once again put their seal of approval on the work done in the constituency by the BJP government in the Centre and in the state.\n\nFormer Pradesh Congress President Ganesh Godiyal who had actively campaigned in favour of the party candidate in Kedarnath, said the Congress could not win the seat due to the division of the anti-establishment votes.\n\n\"Over 51,000 votes were cast in the bypoll. We could not win as we could not keep around 33,000 anti-establishment votes intact,\" Godiyal said.\n\nHowever, he congratulated both Dhami and Nautiyal for the victory in Kedarnath and expressed hope that they will honour the trust reposed by the people in them by pacing up development in the constituency.",

Both the BJP and AJSU suffered losses as they failed to maintain their alliance during the 2019 elections.

This indicates that the company could launch its four generation budget iPhone model sometime in March 2025.

For the unversed, the first gen iPhone SE was launched in March 2016, while the second-gen iPhone SE arrived in April 2020 and the thrid-gen iPhone SE arrived in March 2022.\n\nIn addition to the launch timeline, the new report by MacRumours also states the iPhone SE 4 will the first device in Apple's product lineup that will debut with a 5G modem designed by the company -- a feature, which the company has been working on since 2018 to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on Qualcomm. As per separate reports, the iPhone 17 Air is also likely to come with the company's in-house 5G modem.\n\niPhone SE 4: Everything we know about it so far\n\nAs far as the specifications are concerned, reports have already detailed what we should expect from the third generation iPhone SE when it launches next year. The upcoming iPhone SE 4 is expected to feature a design that is quite similar to the iPhone 14. This would make the first iPhone SE model to ditch the Touch ID and opt for Face ID, which is a standard feature in all premium iPhone models.\n\nOn the display front, the iPhone SE 4 is tipped to get a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz screen refresh rate. The third generation iPhone SE model is expected to be powered by a new A-series chip that would bring support for some of the Apple Intelligence features to the devices. However, older reports suggested that the device could come with A18 chip.",

Many drew comparisons with how Sushant was treated while he was still alive. The MS Dhoni star passed away in Mumbai in June 2020, aged 34.

Bystanders, shocked to witness two film stars fighting in public, gathered around.

Both actors had gone to the DCP office to resolve their issues but ended up in a heated confrontation instead.\n\nOdia Director Bobby Islam and actor Manoj Mishra fought over the film title\n\nA report reveals that the dispute began when Manoj objected to a specific word in the title of an upcoming film. Meanwhile, Bobby accused Manoj of making negative comments about the Odia film industry.\n\n\"Apparently, the bone of contention is Manoj's opposition to the use of a word in the title of a film that a producer is making. On the other hand, Bobby alleged that Manoj has been casting aspersions on the Odia film industry,\" explained the officer, as quoted by the news portal.\n\nOdia Director Bobby Islam | Image: x\n\nManoj, however, claimed that Bobby used the first word of the film’s title to insult him when he arrived at the DCP office. \"I didn’t attack anybody.

		"title": "As Trump Wins Presidency In Remarkable Comeback to White House, A Look at States Voted for Him",
		"text": "Washington: The US presidential election has been a suspenseful race, but after a tough call with the running mate Kamala Harris , former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump managed to secure a historic win.\n\nRepublican nominee Trump has secured 277 Electoral College votes, while Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has 226, based on media projections.\n\nWith 270 votes required to clinch the presidency, Trump secured a historic mandate with a comeback to the White House after 4 years of Democratic rule.\n\nIn the US, winning states is more decisive than the popular vote because each state contributes a set number of electoral votes, reflecting its population.\n\nIn this election, US states are color-coded according to party alignment: red for Republicans and blue for Democrats. However, the pivotal 'purple' swing states, which often decide elections, lean neither way consistently.\n\nLet’s examine the swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for and see where things currently stand.\n\nSwing State Results\n\nSwing states, identified as 'purple' because they shift between red and blue, play an outsized role in the election outcome. Projections indicate Trump is likely to secure all the seven major swing states:\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAs per the news agency AP, p Trump won this battleground state with its 16 electoral votes. Republican turnout meanwhile surpassed 2020 levels, while Democratic voter turnout has fallen, according to AP. Trump previously won North Carolina in 2020 and has seen improved performance in Republican areas this time.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrump also emerged victorious in Georgia. He narrowly lost this state in 2020 by just under 12,000 votes, but he has reclaimed it with incremental gains in deeply red, rural counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTrump will take Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes. This state, a crucial battleground, was flipped by President Joe Biden in 2020, but Trump had previously won it in 2016, becoming the first Republican to do so since 1988.\n\nArizona\n\nTrump has also won Arizona, which accounts for 11 electoral votes.\n\nNevada\n\nNevada is leaning towards Trump, positioning him for the state's six electoral votes.\n\n\n\nPerformance in Red States\n\nRed states who are traditionally supportive of Republicans, are expected to fall in line for Trump. These states typically prioritize conservative values, favor limited government intervention, and are largely rural and suburban. States like Texas, Alabama, and Wyoming are classified as red and have shown continued support for Trump in this election and helped him secure victory.\n\nUtah\n\nDonald Trump won Utah and its six electoral votes in the 2024 US presidential election. Utah has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964.\n\nIdaho\n\nMarking his third consecutive victory in another US state, Trump won Idaho with 60 per cent of the total vote in this election. The state has always been a consistent supporter of Re[publicans.\n\nKansas\n\nThe Republicans won Kansas by securing its six electoral votes and marking the third consecutive victory for Trump, one again.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa's six electoral votes went straight to Donald Trump making him the thirst consecutive winner of the state.\n\nMissouri\n\nTrump also bagged Missouri's 10 electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election. The state has long been a reliable stronghold for Republicans.\n\nTexas\n\nThe former president also won Texas by securing its 40 electoral votes. This did not come as a surprise as the state has leaned towards the Republican in recent presidential races.\n\nOhio\n\nTrump also won Ohio, a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential election. The Republicans bagged 16 electoral votes in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nWinning Wyoming in both 2016 and 2020 with a great margin, Trump won the state this time as well in the presidential race.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDonald Trump won Louisiana with eight electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election. He won the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSecuring three electoral votes, Trump won South Dakota in the 2024 presidential election. South Dakota has always been one of the biggest supporters of the Republican nominee.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nSimilar to South Dakota, Trump won North Dakota as well by securing three electoral votes.\n\nArkansas\n\nThe former president won Arkansas by bagging six electoral votes in the state. This marks his third consecutive victory in this state.\n\nFlorida\n\nIn a not-so-surprising result, Trump won Florida by capturing 30 electoral votes in this presidential race. The state has never supported a Democrat since 1012.\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee, a state that always has been a Republican supporter since the 1990s, gave Trump its 11 electoral votes in this presidential race.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi was won by the former president by sis electoral votes. The state has been a Republican supporter since 1976.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGiving the former president nine electoral voters, South Carolina made Trump win the state for the third consecutive term.\n\nOklahoma\n\nThe state has not supported a Democrat since 1964, and this time too the Republican won it by seven electoral votes.\n\nAlabama\n\nWinning nine electoral votes in the third state, Trump won Alabama in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nTrump won West Virginia with four electoral votes in this presidential race.\n\nIndiana",

		"text": "Peshawar: At least 37 people were killed and several others injured in tribal sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province over last 24 hours, police said on Saturday even as government officials said negotiations with local and tribal elders to restore peace are progressing successfully.\n\nThe clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, in northwest Pakistan took place following Thursday's attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed.\n\nChief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has issued clear instructions to resolve all issues through dialogue and negotiations, ensuring long-term stability in the region, a government spokesperson said.\n\n“At least 37 are dead as at now,” an official tasked with collecting details of the carnage told the media here. More than 30 people are injured, he added.\n\nThe tribes are targeting each other with heavy and automatic weapons, police said.\n\nHomes and shops have been damaged in the fighting and people from various villages have fled to safer locations.\n\nAll educational institutions in the district remained closed on Saturday, confirmed Muhammad Hayat Hassan, chairman of the Private Education Network.\n\nVideos shared from the area showed at least six bodies of the attackers and some charred bodies of the victims. Police also said that there were reports of six women taken as captives but “due to limited connectivity, information and communication is scant to ascertain anything more.” Gunfire continued in Balishkhel, Khar Kali, Kunj Alizai and Maqbal through the day, police said, adding, currently there is intermittent firing from at least three areas in the district, while the Thall-Sada-Parachinar Highway remained closed from traffic towards Kohat district.\n\nAs officials struggled to reinforce peace in the volatile region, communication from the elders of both the tribal sects suggested further intensified attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the KP provincial government dismissed reports of firing at a helicopter carrying a high-level government delegation comprising Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Law Minister, Chief Secretary and Inspector General of Police going towards the Kurram tribal district.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa government spokesman Barrister Dr Saif dismissed as “baseless” the reports of firing on the helicopter in Parachinar area and confirmed that the delegation was completely safe.\n\nThe government delegation was engaged in dialogue with local leaders and tribal elders in Kurram to restore peace and stability following the directives of the chief minister, the spokesman said, adding, peace negotiations were progressing successfully between the two sides.\n\nThe government's top priority was facilitating a ceasefire between the two parties and establishing a lasting peace, he added.\n\nIn the first phase, constructive meetings were held with Shia community leaders, during which critical issues were discussed in depth while in the next phase, deliberations would be conducted with the Sunni community leaders, he added.\n\nThe government's top priority is to facilitate a ceasefire between both parties and establish lasting peace, the spokesperson added.\n\nTribal leaders have already expressed deep concerns as for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel for common citizens.\n\nTwo weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.\n\nIn September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.\n\nThe intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.\n\nThe road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.\n\nThe fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.",

The man, whose name has not been made public, has been ordered to stay in custody for four weeks. He also runs a security company with a dual Norwegian and Eastern European citizen.\n\nAccording to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, following the arrest of the student, the Norwegian police said that they would review the company's operating license. The country’s intelligence agency, PST, said the man was arrested at his home on Wednesday for activities that could harm national security.\n\nThe police found records showing that the man had been in contact with someone who appeared to be directing his spying activities. The man has admitted to gathering and sharing information with Russian and Iranian authorities.\n\nThe court documents state that the man has confessed, but his lawyer, John Christian Elden, says the man does not accept the full charge of espionage. Instead, he admits to working for a foreign country but denies that he intended to harm the security of other countries.\n\nThe man is studying for a degree in security and preparedness at Norway’s Arctic University (UiT). This is the second case involving UiT in recent years. In 2022, a guest researcher at the university, who had claimed to be Brazilian, was arrested for espionage. It was later revealed that he was actually a Russian spy.",

As a result, sentencing in the case has been postponed indefinitely amidst both sides debating the future of the case in the wake of Trump’s recent electoral win.",

Batting first, India endured a nasty collapse and eventually bundled out at a score of 150. It was advantage Australia till then but Jasprit Bumrah turned the tide and rattled the Aussies in their backyard at the pacers paradise in Perth.\n\nJasprit Bumrah Gets Special Praise From Aakash Chopra\n\nHaving taken the captaincy onus in the absence of Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah has led from the front and left Australia reeling. First, he removed the openers cheaply, then got rid of the mighty Steve Smith on the first ball. Later in the day, he took the scalp of Marnus Labuschagne as well. Bumrah finished the day with outstanding figures of 10 overs 17 runs and four wickets. Moreover, in response to India's 150, Australia are beleaguered at 67/7 at Stumps on Day 1 of the 1st Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nWith this exceptional performance, Jasprit Bumrah has gained worldwide acclaim. Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra is also on the list of individuals who have showered praise on Bumrah. Chopra hailed Jasprit Bumrah as the \"Rolls-Royce of fast bowling.\"\n\n\"The way Jasprit Bumrah brought India back into the game was worth watching because when India were all out for 150, it seemed like it was over and out. However, it was not over and out. Jassi jaisa koi nahin. He is 24-carat pure gold,\" he said.",

This comes just days before the IPL 2025 auction, which is slated to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on November 24 and 25.\n\nAccording to Cricbuzz, the BCCI has communicated this to the IPL franchises ahead of the auction. This move by the BCCI has sent shockwaves among the IPL franchises, who were gearing up for the auction. The banning of Manish Pandey in particular, will come as a blow to his team, as he is an experienced player who has been integral to his team's success.\n\nMeanwhile, the BCCI has also unveiled the schedules for the next three Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons, providing unprecedented clarity and foresight for the coveted T20 tournament. The upcoming 2025 season will commence on March 14 (Friday) and culminate on May 25 (Sunday).\n\nMoreover, the BCCI has announced the dates for the subsequent two seasons. The IPL 2026 season will begin on March 15 (Sunday) and conclude on May 31 (Sunday). The IPL 2027 season will start on March 14 (Sunday) and end on May 30 (Sunday).",

The batting failure seemingly affected his fielding as well. The Indian batter dropped a sitter to give Marnus Labuschagne a chance, which on another day could have punished India dearly. Fortunately for the visitors, stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah had it covered as he got rid of Labuschagne later in the day in Perth.\n\nDavid Warner On Virat Kohli Dropping a Sitter\n\nThe slip-catching on Day 1 of the first Test was top-notch from both sides. Barring the dropped catch by Virat Kohli, all the other airborne to the keeper and adjacent to him met with a pair of safe hands. Kohli received severe flak for putting down an easy take. However, as experts try to break down the reason behind every act, former Australian opener David Warner did the same on Kohli's drop.\n\n\"He had it in his hands and because today we saw it with Mitchell Starc in the Ashes at Lords.\" Warner while speaking on FOX Cricket.\n\n\"You catch the ball and as soon as the ball is in your hands, you place it on the ground, it was almost like he was too worried about catching the ball and then putting his hand on the ground and keeping it upright.",

		"title": "'The Sound It Made': Mitchell Starc Gives His Verdict on KL Rahul's Controversial Dismissal",
		"text": "Australian pacer Mitchell Starc downplayed the controversy surrounding KL Rahul's disputed caught-behind dismissal on the first day of the opening Test, simply stating it was a \"regulation wicket\". Rahul's dismissal sparked debate among former players from both teams, questioning the third umpire's decision to overturn the on-field official's initial not-out call.\n\nAfter on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough initially ruled in Rahul's favor, Australia challenged the decision using DRS. However, third umpire Richard Illingworth overturned the call without the benefit of a split-screen view, which would have provided a clearer picture of whether the ball grazed the bat or triggered the snicko response due to a hit on the pads. Despite the controversy, Mitchell Starc remained unfazed, focusing on the game ahead.\n\nMitchell Starc opens up on KL Rahul's dismissal\n\n\"It got overturned obviously, but I thought it was regulation, the sound it made, the timing of it, I thought it was just a regulation wicket,\" Starc said at a press conference.\n\nStarc (2/14), who bagged the opening wicket of the series when he removed Yashasvi Jaiswal, will resume on six not out alongside wicketkeeper Alex Carey, who is unbeaten on 19, on Saturday, with Australia at 67/7 after India made 150 in their first innings.\n\nA staggering 17 wickets fell on the opening day, a record on Australian soil, but the leading pacer believed batting is going to get easier in the second innings and they just need to survive the new Kookaburra ball.\n\n\"I think there was a fair bit of good bowling today. Obviously, there was enough in the wicket and it probably felt like it was a hardball wicket,\" Starc said.\n\n\"When the ball started to get a little bit softer towards the back end of that Indian innings, it probably didn't do as much. (There was) still enough there, but it didn't do as much as the brand new hardball.\n\n\"So I guess that's something for teams to take in the second innings.\n\n\"If you can get through the testing period, it does get slightly easier. That being said, the outfield is quite slow, so that probably made runs a bit hard to come by. That's probably the slowest outfield we've seen over in the west for a long time.\"\n\nWhile Mitchell Starc gave the first breakthrough, his pace-bowling colleague Josh Hazlewood proved to be more successful on the day, returning with excellent figures of 4/29 in 13 overs before the peerless Jasprit Bumrah (4/17 in 10 overs) yet again displayed his extraordinary skills.\n\nStarc is also not of the view that batting conditions were becoming harder across Australia.\n\n\"How many ways can you skin a cat? Bowlers are allowed to bowl good balls,\" he said.\n\n\"When there's a lot of runs, it's like, 'Oh, the bowlers bowled badly. When there's wickets, the wickets are tough'. (But) you are allowed to bowl good balls and maybe credit should go to both teams and bowlers.\n\n\"Sure, there's plenty in the wicket when you put it in the right area and it was hard work for batting, but as I said, you're allowed to bowl good balls and there were plenty of those today.\"\n\nAt stumps, Australia trailed by 83 runs thanks to the incredible comeback by the Bumrah-led Indian team, something that seemed improbable after they were all out for an under-par score and weeks after their unprecedented 0-3 drubbing to New Zealand at home.\n\nStarc said he was not surprised by India's comeback.\n\n\"That was a completely different series, different conditions, different teams, so, yeah, that was entertaining to watch, that series .. but we know how good a team India are and they have shown that today.\n\n\"I thought we bowled quite well and perhaps an under-par score and they have come out and matched us with the ball, so, no, I wouldn't say I was surprised as we know the skill they have got in that team with bat and ball, and they showed that with the ball today,\" Starc pointed out.",

As per an official statement by RBI, the agreement aims to facilitate the use of INR and MVR in various economic and financial transactions between both the countries.\n\nIt covers current account transactions, permissible capital account transactions, and other agreed-upon activities. This initiative is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs and settlement time, making cross-border trade more efficient.\n\nRBI said, \"This framework would enable exporters and importers to invoice and settle in their respective domestic currencies, which in turn would enable the development of trading in INR-MVR pair in foreign exchange market\".\n\nUnder this framework, exporters and importers from both nations can invoice and settle trade transactions in their respective domestic currencies.

		"text": "New Delhi: India's economy is projected to grow at a faster pace in the third quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2024) compared to the first half (April-September 2024), according to a report by ICRA.\n\nThe report stated that this optimism is based on improving economic indicators and robust activity levels in various sectors. The report added that the preliminary data for November 2024 indicates a positive trend.\n\nThe growth in electricity demand has picked up due to a favourable base effect, while festive season demand continues to drive an increase in vehicle registrations.\n\nIt said \"These trends reinforce ICRA's expectations of a pick-up in the GDP growth in Q3 FY2025 as compared to H1 FY2025\".\n\nAs per the report, several indicators related to mobility and transportation have shown significant improvement. Vehicle registrations surged to 32.4 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, a sharp recovery from a contraction of 8.7 per cent in September 2024.\n\nThis increase was fueled by strong demand for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles. Petrol consumption rose to 8.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent in September, and domestic air passenger traffic increased to 9.6 per cent from 6.4 per cent.\n\nAdditionally, two-wheeler production grew by 13.4 per cent, rail freight improved to 1.5 per cent from a decline of 0.7 per cent, and diesel consumption recorded marginal growth of 0.1 per cent after a contraction of 1.9 per cent in September.\n\nThe report also added that the country's non-oil exports also posted a strong performance, growing by 25.6 per cent in October 2024 compared to 6.8 per cent in September. Key contributors to this growth include electronic goods, engineering goods, chemicals, and readymade garments.\n\nThe ICRA's Business Activity Monitor, a composite indicator of economic activity, showed a year-on-year growth of 10.1 per cent in October 2024, the highest in eight months. This is an improvement from the 6.6 per cent growth recorded in September 2024, despite challenges from a high base effect.",

People say pandemics are going to be more regular over the next century, so we can't be satisfied about building up debt.\"\n\nRajan added that his warning is appropriate for the US as its debt trajectory is increasing steadily, as per IMF forecasts released a month ago. United States President-elect Donald Trump is currently weighing whom to appoint to manage the country's borrowings as and when he takes over the White House.\n\nHe also added that this level of debt is a vulnerability and people should not be satisfied with it, pointing at the United States.\n\nBy the end of this year, global public debt is set to reach $100 trillion or 93% of global gross domestic product, driven by the US and China, as per IMF.\n\nSlowing inflation and falling interest rates continue to offer governments a window to get their fiscal houses in order, according to the IMF, but there is no urgency to do so.",

		"title": "Trump Unleashing Tariffs On China In Early 2025? What Do Chinese Economists Think?",
		"text": "The United States is likely to impose nearly 40% tariffs on imports from China early next year, according to media reports.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is set to take office from January onwards, and he pledged during his campaign to slap heavy tariffs on Chinese imports in line with his \"America First\" trade policy. This has caused a lot of discomfort to Beijing and has increased growth risks for China.\n\nReuters recently conducted a poll of economists which showed the tariffs posed by the United States could slice growth in the country by up to 1 percentage point.\n\nAs compared to the earlier tariff rates, which were 7.5%-25% that the US levied from China, the threatened tariff rates are much higher during Trump's first term and the economy is also in a much more vulnerable position due to prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand.\n\nThe poll was conducted between more than 50 economists from November 13- November 20 and it showed a strong majority both in and outside mainland China, as it expects Trump to impose these tariffs by early next year with a median estimate of 38% and projections ranging from 15% to 60%.\n\nWhat Do These Economists Think?\n\nMost of these economists do not expect a blanket 60% tariffs on Chinese goods in the first half of the year as this will accelerate inflation within the US.\n\n\"We expect the new U.S. administration to bring back the original plan of Trump 1.0,\" ANZ's chief economist Raymond Yeung said, estimating that the average tariff on Chinese goods could be raised by 32–37%.\n\nChinese policymakers have been pressured with the domestic demand to offset an expected drop in exports - a key driver of growth, according to analysts.\n\nThe poll predicted that the new US tariffs would reduce China's 2025 economic growth by around 0.5-1.0 percentage point.\n\nAll economists are eagerly waiting for trump administration's China trade policies which could lead to potential downgrades in China's outlook.\n\nHowever, they still hope that exports will be a key pillar for growth as the global demands remain strong.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters have also lowered their consumer price inflation forecasts to 1.1% for next year and 1.4% for 2026, down from the previously anticipated 1.4% and 1.6% in the October survey.",

		"text": "Nayanthara-Dhanush Feud Timeline: The actors are currently embroiled in a public dispute. The Jawan actress has written a three-page letter that slammed Dhanush for sending a legal notice demanding Rs 10 crore in damages after the trailer of the documentary, titled Nayanthara: Beyond The Fairy Tale, was released online. However, the actor duo were once good friends.\n\nNayanthara-Dhanush friendship dates back to 2008\n\nNayanthara and Dhanush shared the screenspace in the 2008 film Yaaradi Nee Mohini. Their chemistry in the romantic drama was widely appreciated critically and commercially. The actors became good friends on the set of the film and this was reflected in the promotional event of the movie.\n\n\n\nA file photo of Nayanthara | Image: Instagram\n\nTheir chemistry was not just appreciated in the movie but also in the pre-release events. They went on to star together in several hit films like Maari (2015), Kaashmora (2016), Ethir Neechal (2013) and Kuselan (2008) among others.\n\nWhen Dhanush's film Naanum Rowdy Dhan gave Nayanthara's career a new lease of life after comeback\n\nIn 2011, Nayanthara decided to quit films. This decision is now being linked to her alleged affair with Prabhudeva, who reportedly stopped her from working in films. However, when the Lady Superstar decided to make a comeback in 2013, the film Raja Rani emerged as a box-office blockbuster.\n\n\n\nNayanthara and Vijay Sethupati in <i>Naanum Rowdy Dhan | Image: X</i>\n\nThe projects following this did not work out well for the actress. It was only in 2015 that Nayanthara gave a hit with Naanum Rowdy Dhan which was directed by her husband Vijay Sethupathi. The movie was produced by Dhanush. The roots of animosity between the actors were sowed during the production of the film Naanum Rowdy Dhan.\n\nHow Naanum Rowdy Dhan became a bone of contention between Nayanthara and Dhanush\n\nThe 2015 film was produced by Dhanush and was directed by Nayanthara's husband Vignesh Sivan. It was reported that the 3 actor was not happy with the production of the film and the performance of the actress. It was alleged that Sivan exceeded the film's budget for which the actress had to pitch in funds from her own pocket.\n\n\n\nNayanthara and Vijay Sethupati in <i>Naanum Rowdy Dhan | Image: X</i>\n\nEven though the film was a success at the box office, it was said that it was a financial liability for Dhanush. The delays in production led to massive cost overruns on the film. This led to a cold war between Nayanthara and Dhanush.\n\nWhen Nayanthara took an indirect dig at Dhanush for the first time\n\nNayanthara and Dhanush in a selfie | Image: X\n\nNayanthara's performance in Naanum Rowdy Dhan was widely appreciated by the critics and audience alike. However, it was said that Dhanush did not like her acting in the project. The actress even won several awards for her role and during the acceptance speech at one such event, she said, \"Thank you, Dhanush, for initiating NRD (Naanum Rowdy Dhaan), and I have to say I am sorry also. Dhanush absolutely hated my performance in Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. Sorry Dhanush for disappointing you with my performance. I’ll probably make it better next time.”\n\nNayanthara exposes Dhanush in her documentary\n\nNayanthara planned a documentary on her love life with Vignesh Shivan which featured parts of Naanum Rowdy Dhan. Even after a 2-year long battle, Dhanush refused to give an NOC to the actress to use the clips from his production. This led to the documentary being pivoted to another direction and focusing on her entire life. This led to the actress writing a 3-page open letter to the actor. The 39-year-old actor said she was shocked after receiving a legal notice for using a three-second behind-the-scenes clip in the documentary.",

		"text": "Vikrant Massey has found fame anew since his movie 12th Fail became a hit. He is currently promoting his latest release Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, alongside Taapsee Pannu and Sunny Kaushal. In his personal life, Massey married Sheetal Thakur in a private ceremony in 2022, and the couple recently welcomed a son.\n\nIn 2020, Vikrant Massey announced that he had bought his dream house. The home is thoughtfully decorated and showcases a simple yet elegant style bearing resemblance to the actors' nature. With a spacious balcony overlooking the sea and cosy interiors, every corner radiates warmth and comfort.\n\nInside Vikrant Massey's 180-degree view balcony\n\nAs per the reports, Vikrant Massey’s Madh Island home in Mumbai offers stunning panoramic views of the Arabian Sea.

		"title": "Adaptive Defence is Essential, Not Optional, Says India's Defence Minister at Defence Dialogue",
		"text": "New Delhi, India- In a call to address the rapidly evolving global threat landscape, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh outlined India’s commitment to building an \"Adaptive Defence\" approach. Speaking at the inaugural session of the Delhi Defence Dialogue (DDD) in New Delhi, hosted by the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), Singh underscored the Modi-led government’s focus on creating a resilient, technologically advanced defence framework to counter modern security challenges. The theme of this year’s conference, “Adaptive Defence: Navigating the Changing Landscape of Modern Warfare”, provided a timely platform for exploring collaborative approaches in defence strategy, with the dialogue drawing participation from policy experts, military leaders, and strategic scholars.\n\nRaksha Mantri highlighted adaptive defence as essential in the modern security context, characterizing it as a proactive rather than reactive strategy. “Adaptive Defence is not just a strategic choice; it is a necessity in our fast-paced world. Today’s defence demands continuous evolution to counter emergent threats effectively,” he stated. This approach, he explained, encompasses situational awareness, flexibility at strategic and tactical levels, resilience, and integration with next-generation technologies. “It is about cultivating the mindset to anticipate challenges and prepare proactively for the unknown,” Singh emphasized, urging the military to embrace agility and innovation.\n\nRedefining Warfare: The Role of Emerging Technologies\n\nSingh noted that warfare is increasingly conducted in the Grey Zone—where traditional tactics are augmented by unconventional methods like cyber and hybrid warfare. Emphasizing that conventional defensive measures must now adapt to these evolving tactics, he detailed India’s focus on leveraging emerging technologies such as drones, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and quantum computing. “India aspires to become a global hub for drone technology, contributing to our ‘Make in India’ and Aatmanirbhar Bharat programs,” he said. Singh highlighted initiatives such as the Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) and ADITI schemes that incentivize domestic innovation in defence technology, strengthening India’s military-industrial ecosystem.\n\nStressing the importance of collective responses to shared security challenges, Singh remarked, “Interconnectedness is as much a blessing as it is a challenge. If our threats are transnational, so should be our solutions.” In his address, he advocated for collaboration across states and institutions to address threats that transcend national borders. As cyber threats, hybrid warfare, and technological advancements reshape the global security environment, the Defence Minister argued that India must adopt a multifaceted approach that fosters joint responses among states, non-state actors, and private sector partners.\n\nStrengthening the Defence Ecosystem\n\nTo secure India’s defence capabilities, the government has introduced numerous initiatives promoting indigenous development and self-reliance. Singh cited examples of significant achievements, including the domestically produced Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, and missile systems developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). “These projects exemplify our commitment to self-reliance without isolation. We welcome foreign collaboration in R&D, co-production, and joint ventures, all within the broader framework of Make in India,” he asserted.\n\nAcknowledging the necessity of international cooperation, he noted that global interdependence allows nations to overcome resource and technological limitations. Singh argued that the pursuit of robust defence systems in today’s globalised economy requires logical collaboration to access broader expertise, economies of scale, and advanced technology.\n\nIn light of today’s digital threats, Singh addressed the rise of psychological and information warfare, calling it an unprecedented challenge to national security. “The government is resolute in employing adaptive defence strategies to counter these digital threats,” he affirmed. This stance reflects the government’s dedication to maintaining a forward-looking posture against both physical and psychological warfare, with special emphasis on countering misinformation and cyber-attacks.\n\nDefence Exports: Pushing for Economic Growth and Strategic Reach\n\nIndia has also set ambitious goals for expanding its defence exports, aiming to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. Notably, India’s defence exports now reach over 100 nations, with the United States, France, and Armenia as top recipients in 2023-24. Singh emphasized that these exports not only contribute to the nation’s economic goals but also bolster its strategic reach and global presence.\n\nThe Delhi Defence Dialogue serves as MP-IDSA’s flagship platform for addressing complex defence challenges, and fostering dialogue among policymakers, military experts, and scholars on the changing landscape of security.\n\nThe defence minister commended the DDD’s role in facilitating informed discussions and generating strategies for enhancing India’s defence posture. He expressed confidence that the DDD would pave the way for stronger strategic partnerships and more robust national security frameworks through shared expertise and collaborative innovation.",

It is the foundation of social advancement and scientific advancement,\" Huang told media during a visit to Hong Kong.\n\nGlobal cooperation is \"going to continue.

You're at the starting lines with everybody else. An industry is being reinvented. You now have the instruments, the instruments necessary to advance science in so many different fields,\" Huang said.\n\n\"The greatest challenges of our time, unimaginable challenges to overcome in the past, all of a sudden seem possible to tackle.\"",

The plaintiffs contend Tesla knew about the alleged defect as early as 2015 and did not warn customers.\n\nTesla denied that it had knowledge of the alleged braking defect before one of the plaintiffs purchased his vehicle in early 2021.\n\nThe company argued that the plaintiffs had not pointed to any specific communications with buyers that concealed information about the defect.\n\nAlexakis said the lawsuit “successfully connects the dots” between Tesla’s alleged omission of safety information on its website and buyers' reliance on the website to make purchase decisions.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiffs could file an amended complaint seeking to revive their insurance premium claims.",

		"text": "Nissan persuaded a federal appeals court on Friday to decertify 10 class actions accusing the Japanese automaker of selling cars and SUVs with defective automatic emergency braking systems that caused vehicles to stop suddenly for no reason.\n\nThe 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said it was improper to let drivers of 14 Nissan models sue in groups under the laws of 10 individual states simply by claiming that the braking systems did not work.\n\nDrivers claimed they experienced \"phantom\" activations of the systems at low overpasses, parking garages and railroad crossings, instead of when collisions might be imminent.\n\nWriting for a three-judge panel, however, Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton said some drivers may never have experienced sudden braking, or sought repairs to begin with.\n\nHe also said Nissan created \"distinct\" software upgrades for different models that appeared to fix the problem for some drivers, suggesting there was no common defect.\n\n\"Analyzing the various manifestations of the alleged defect is necessary to assess whether common evidence could vindicate the plaintiffs or Nissan on a classwide basis,\" Sutton wrote.\n\nClass actions let plaintiffs potentially obtain greater remedies at lower costs than if forced to sue individually.\n\nThe litigation covers Nissan's Rogue from 2017 to 2020, Rogue Sport from 2017 to 2021, Altima from 2019 to 2021, and Kicks from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThe 10 states are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nLawyers for the drivers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nissan and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe appeals court returned the case to a trial judge in Nashville, Tennessee, for further proceedings, potentially allowing new evidence supporting class certification.

		"title": "Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Feature Loaded SUV with Better Boot Space",
		"text": "Mahindra XUV 3XO Review: Mahindra recently updated the XUV 300 in India and gave it a new name: XUV 3XO. It is a sub-4m compact SUV with turbo petrol and diesel engines. It has a comfortable cabin and offers a multitude of features such as driving modes, a wireless charger, and more. The company provides two turbo petrol engine options, two IRVM (Internal Rear View Mirror) options, and two sunroof options across variants.\n\nMahindra has revised the exterior design, updated the interiors, and added some first-in-segment features such as dual-zone climate control, and a powerful diesel engine with highest torque in the segment. The XUV 3XO competes against the Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, and Kia Sonet in its segment.\n\nWe got our hands on the Mahindra XUV 3XO AX7 L variant with a TGDI petrol engine and here are our thoughts about the SUV.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Price:\n\nThe price of the Mahindra XUV 3XO starts at Rs 7.79 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base MX2 1.2 Petrol variant and it goes all the way up to Rs 15.49 lakh (ex-showroom) for the AX7 L 1.2 Petrol AT variant.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Exterior Design:\n\nThe exterior design of the Mahindra XUV 3XO is revised and gets a new front and rear profile. Starting with the front, there are all LED headlamps and DRLs and the fog lamps are also LED. The LED headlights gave great visibility at night while cruising on highways. There are front parking cameras and sensors to ease out parking in tight spaces. Mahindra says ground clearance is a generous 201mm, up from the XUV300’s figure of 180mm.\n\nOn the side, the length and proportions remain unchanged. The top-spec variant runs on 17-inch alloy wheels with front and rear disc brakes. The in-rest and the eg-rest into the SUV is easy. The XUV 3XO is available in eight colour options with top-spec AX7 and AX7 L versions distinguishable by their contrasting roofs.\n\nAt the rear, the XUV 3XO gets a connected LED DRL and LED taillight setup with a subtle roof spoiler. Mahindra could have offered a shark-fin antenna instead of the regular pole antenna, which would have enhance the look and feel of the SUV. Nonetheless, it still looks appealing.\n\nThe boot space is still an issue in the XUV 3XO and is the least in the segment. With the parcel tray in, there's hardly any space for big luggage to fit in the boot. The rear bumper gets a black and silver accent, enhancing the sporty aesthetics of the SUV.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Interiors:\n\nAs we step inside, the interiors of the XUV 3XO have been revised and the cabin quality has received significant improvements over the XUV 300. The dashboard gets a soft-touch finish on the top-spec trim and the centre console gets gloss black, which attracts a lot of fingerprints. The perforated seats look upmarket but the cream colour upholstery would require maintenance and regular dry-cleanings. The dashboard gets the 10.25-inch infotainment system and the instrument cluster is inspired by the XUV 700 as it gets the 10.25-inch digital dials.\n\nSince the Mahindra XUV 3XO has a wheelbase of 2,600mm, the space inside is decent. The rear seats offer comfortable seating and there is ample knee room, legroom, and shoulder room for three passengers. The presence of the rear AC vents and USB type-C charging ports enhances the rear seat experience.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Features:\n\nWith the XUV 3XO, Mahindra has added some new features and deleted some others. We tested the AX7 L variant of the SUV, which hosted a 10.25-inch infotainment screen. This screen offers a 360-degree view of the parking cameras, which offers decent resolution even in the dark. However, we experienced some lag in the feed of the 360-degree camera. Additionally, the Mahindra XUV 3XO misses out on support for Apple CarPlay, which is a major bummer for iPhone users.\n\nComing to the audio, our test unit was equipped with two tweeters, a four-speaker, and a subwoofer Harman Kardon sound system. The sound output was good and elevated the driving experience.\n\nBeyond the above mentioned features, the XUV 3XO also offers dual-zone climate control, and auto-dimming IRVM, which are missing in its elder sibling, the Mahindra XUV 700. It also includes a 65W fast-charging Type-C port -- a feature exclusive to the XUV 3XO -- that can even charge laptops. With the facelift, Mahindra has also included an electronic parking brake with an auto hold function, enhancing the driving experience. Our test unit was equipped with a panoramic sunroof. Operating it led to a call to the driver's Emergency SOS contact, which is a major glitch in the SUV's system. Despite offering multiple top-of-the-line features such as X and Y, it misses out on some other key features such as front-ventilated seats, ambient lighting, and paddle shifters in the automatic transmission.\n\nTalking about safety, Mahindra XUV 3XO recently scored a five-star safety rating for the adult occupants in the Bharat NCAP. It is offered with six airbags, ABS, EBD, traction control, and more. The higher spec variants are offered with tyre pressure monitoring system and blind view monitor.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Engine and Driving Experience:\n\nMahindra offers the XUV 3XO with a 1.2-litre MPFI turbo petrol engine, a 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine, and a 1.5-litre diesel engine. We tested the 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine with a six-speed torque converter gearbox. The 1.2-litre TGDI turbo petrol engine is an in-line three-cylinder unit and produces 130 BHP and 230 Nm torque, mated to a six-speed manual or a torque converter gearbox.\n\nThe drive of the XUV 3XO is smooth despite being a three-cylinder engine. It is refined and the vibrations are evident at certain levels or in the higher band of the rev range. The steering is smooth and feels disconnected and the body roll is present\n\nThere are three riding modes on offer: Zip, Zap, and Zoom. While the Zip mode is Mahindra's word for the Eco mode, the Zap mode is the Normal mode and the Zoom Mode is the Sports Mode. We kept the vehicle on Zip mode for maximum time to gain better fuel efficiency and the experience was decent. The SUV was punchy with the sudden throttle inputs and the power was available post 2000 RPM.\n\nMahindra offers camera and radar-based Level-2 ADAS features on the XUV 3XO and those worked effortlessly in our test. The Adaptive Cruise Control maintained the speed and distance from the vehicle ahead the Lane Keep Assist maintained the lane on highways. The auto high-beam assist elevated the night drive experience. All the features we tried worked well but what does need a reshuffle is the menu for ADAS. It is tucked into the digital dials, which isn’t quick to access and requires driver attention.\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Fuel Efficiency:\n\nMahindra claims a fuel efficiency of 18.2 km/l for the 1.2-litre TGDI petrol automatic variant. During our test, the car showed a fuel efficiency of 15.5 km/l on the MID. Also, it would not make an upshift to the sixth gear unless the car crosses a speed of 90 km/h. Till then the car would be in the fifth gear with a speed of around 85 km/h sticking to 2000-2100 RPM, thus hampering the fuel efficiency.\n\nAlso Read: Top three automakers in PV segment with highest EV sales in October 2024\n\nMahindra XUV 3XO Suspension:\n\nThe suspensions of the XUV 3XO are tuned on the softer side. It provided a comfortable ride in the city but became bouncy at triple-digit speeds and bad patches filtered inside the cabin. There was decent cabin insulation and only suspension noise was evident.\n\nConclusion:",

		"title": "Amazon Doubles Down on AI Startup Anthropic with $4 Billion Investment",
		"text": "Amazon.com pumped another $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic, as the e-commerce giant goes up against Big Tech rivals in a race to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nThis doubles Amazon's investment in the firm known for its GenAI chatbot Claude, but it remains a minority investor, the startup said on Friday. Similar to Amazon's previous $4 billion investment, it comes in the form of convertible notes and comes in phases, first at $1.3 billion.\n\nAnthropic is also in talks with additional investors to raise more capital on the back of Amazon backing, sources added, who requested anonymity for discussing private matters. Anthropic declined to comment.\n\nAmazon, which has gradually established itself as Anthropic's primary cloud partner, is fiercely competing with Microsoft and Alphabet's Google to offer AI-powered tools for its cloud customers. AWS is bringing significant revenue to Anthropic as a major distributor of its latest models.\n\n\"The investment in Anthropic is essential for Amazon to stay in a leadership position in AI,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nThe e-commerce company's increased investment in Anthropic underscores the billions of dollars funneled into AI startups over the past year, as investors look to cash in on a boom in the technology, which became popular with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI raised $6.6 billion from investors last month, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\n\nAnthropic plans to train and deploy its foundational models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. The intensive process of training AI models requires powerful processors, making securing pricey AI chips a top priority for startups.\n\n\"It (partnership) also allows Amazon to promote its AI services such as leveraging its AI chips for training and inferencing, which Anthropic is using,\" Luria said.\n\nNvidia currently dominates the market for AI processors and counts Amazon among its long list of so-called hyperscaler customers.\n\nStill, Amazon has been working to develop its own chips through its Annapurna Labs division, which Anthropic said it was \"working closely with\" to aid in developing processors. Amazon has also been trying to build its own AI model code-named “Olympus,” which it hasn't released.\n\nAnthropic, co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, said last year it had secured a $500 million investment from Alphabet, which promised to invest another $1.5 billion over time.",

		"text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly appointed Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the United States, has previously spoken about what he describes as his “terrible” voice, a condition known as spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nRFK Jr.'s first noticed a change in his voice at the age of 42\n\nEarlier this year, the 70-year-old Health Secretary told the Los Angeles Times that he “can’t stand” the sound of his voice. “My voice doesn’t really get tired,” the 70-year-old continued, “But the injury is neurological, so actually, the more I use the voice, the stronger it tends to get.” He added, “If I could sound better, I would.”\n\nKennedy revealed to the paper that he first noticed a change in his voice in 1996, at the age of 42. While he acknowledges there is no evidence linking the flu vaccine to his condition, he considers it “at least a potential culprit.”\n\nWhat is spasmodic dysphonia?\n\nSpasmodic dysphonia is also known by another name ​Laryngeal Dystonia, it is a condition where people with this condition suffer from voice and speech disorders.\n\nIn a publication released by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Alexander Hillel, M.D. states that spasmodic dysphonia “causes involuntary spasms in the muscles of the voice box or larynx. This causes the voice to break and have a tight, strained or strangled sound.”\n\nThere are three types of spasmodic dysphonia: adductor spasmodic dysphonia, abductor spasmodic dysphonia, and mixed spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hillel, spasmodic dysphonia is a lifelong condition and “most often affects women, with symptoms starting between the ages of 30 and 50.”\n\nWhat are the causes of spasmodic dysphonia?",

The main motive for celebrating Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month is to spread awareness to the public and also support those affected by pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhat is the pancreas?\n\nJust like any other organ in your body, the pancreas is also an organ that sits behind your stomach, just near your small intestine. According to reports, this pancreas releases enzymes to help a person digest food while regulating your body to manage glucose.\n\n<i>(Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. Rep Pic.

However, here are some common signs of a person whose pancreas might be in trouble according to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\n\nAbdominal bloating: This condition is also known as Ascites, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen which causes the belly to become swollen and distended.\n\nUnexplained weight loss: If you have noticed someone who has lost appetite and desire for certain food while experiencing unexplained weight loss, it could be a sign of cancer cachexia.\n\nJaundice: Is your skin or eyes turning into yellowish colour? this condition is called jaundice which is caused by “excess bilirubin - a component of bile - in the blood.\" explains Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. “A tumor in the head of the pancreas can cause narrowing of the bile duct and block the bile flowing from the gallbladder into the small intestine. Blockage of the bile duct causes a buildup of bilirubin.\"",

		"text": "New Delhi: As India-Canada diplomatic crisis continues to deepen over the issue of Khalistani extremism, the Indian Consulate in Toronto has cancelled some more consular camps in the country, citing security concerns.\n\nIt was confirmed through an official statement by the Indian Consulate in Toronto issued on Thursday. The Indian Consulate said that the decision comes in the wake of Canadian security agencies' inability in providing \"minimum security against heightened threats\" to members of the Indian diaspora.\n\nThe official statement read, “Due to continued inability conveyed by security agencies to provide minimum security against heightened threats, Consulate has had to cancel some more consular camps. Most of them were not at any places of worship, including one at a Police facility.\"\n\nThis comes days after the Indian High Commission in Canada announced to cancel some of the planned consular camps following attacks by Khalistani mobs on two such camps in Brampton and Surrey on November 2 and 3.\n\nThe Indian Consulate also acknowledged the challenges faced by the elderly members of the Indian diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area \"who have been deprived of an essential consular service.”\n\n\"Consulate is fully sensitive to the difficulties faced by close to 4,000 elderly members of the diaspora in the Greater Toronto Area- both Indian and Canadian nationals- who have been deprived of an essential consular service,” the statement further read.\n\nHindu Temple Attacked in Canada\n\nEarlier on November 2, a pro-Khalistan mob entered the premises of a Hindu temple in Brampton and attacked the devotees present there. The Hindu Sabha Temple was organising the consular camp and the Peel Police of Ontario province failed to protect and act against the Khalistani attackers, raising serious security concerns. So far, four people, including a top operative of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), were arrested in connection with the attack.\n\nHowever, the Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistani outfit banned in India, said its supporters were protesting the presence of Indian consular officials who had come to assist in administrative services.\n\nThe Indian High Commission was providing Canadian-Indians with essential services which were targeted by anti-India forces.\n\nIn the wake of the attacks on the Indian-Canadian community in Brampton, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said that consular services faced a major blow due to security concerns and also expressed hope that the camps would continue in other cities.\n\nIndia-Canada Diplomatic Ties\n\nThe diplomatic relations between India and Canada have continuously deteriorated after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly levelled allegations against Indian govt of being involved in the murder plot of Khalistani sepratst Hardeep Sing Nijjar on Canadian soil last year. Nijjar was designated as a terrorist by India.",

		"text": "Halifax: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government announced plans on Thursday to temporarily lift the federal sales tax off a number of items and send checks to millions of Canadians who are dealing with rising costs and as a federal election looms.\n\nThe measures come as a cost of living crisis has left voters unhappy with Trudeau and ahead of an election that could come anytime between this fall and next October.\n\n“Our government can't set prices at the checkout, but we can put more money in people's pockets,” Trudeau said at a press conference in Toronto.\n\nUnder the plan, Canadians who worked in 2023 and earned up to 150,000 Canadian dollars (USD 107,440) will receive a check for 250 Canadian dollars. Trudeau noted that even those earning at the high end of that amount have been struggling to get by.\n\nAn estimated 18.7 million Canadians will receive the one-time check.\n\nThe federal goods and services tax break would begin December 14 and end February 15.\n\nThe government said the tax break will apply to a number of items including children's clothing and shoes, toys, diapers, restaurant meals, beer and wine. It also applies to Christmas trees, a variety of snack foods and beverages and video game consoles.\n\nTrudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, as they don't hold an outright majority themselves.\n\nTrudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country's liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

		"text": "Washington: US intelligence officials warned American defence companies on Thursday to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.\n\nThe public bulletin issued by the National Counterintelligence and Security Centre advised companies involved in defence work — particularly those providing support to Ukraine in its war against Russia — to step up their defences in the face of Russia's escalating aggression toward Ukraine's allies.\n\n“Russia's sabotage activities in Europe increase the risk to US companies abroad and potentially at home,\" the officials wrote in the warning. “Such sabotage operations can sow fear and doubt, damage important infrastructure, disrupt commerce, or cause injury and death.” US and European intelligence officials have said Russia perpetrated several recent acts of sabotage targeting European defense companies, logistics facilities, public utilities and military installations.\n\nOften, the officials said, Russian intelligence has hired local criminals to carry out the acts, which include arson attacks in the United Kingdom and Poland.\n\nEarlier this month, security officials blamed Russia for a plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England.\n\nAlong with disinformation and propaganda, it's part of a larger hybrid effort to undermine the ability of Ukraine's allies to support its defense against Russia's invasion.\n\nRussia has denied the allegations. A message left with Russia's embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.\n\nThe National Counterintelligence and Security Center is an agency within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, focused on protecting national assets from intelligence threats. Thursday's bulletin was jointly issued by the FBI and several Department of Defence agencies.",

		"title": "Food Affordability Crisis in Canada: 1 in 4 Canadian Parents Cutting Back on Food to Feed Children",
		"text": "Ottawa: Canada is facing one of its most severe economic crises, with inflation, skyrocketing grocery bills, and housing costs leaving families across the country struggling to meet their basic needs, even food. An alarming report from the Salvation Army, a non-profit organisation, revealed that 24% of Canadian parents have been forced to reduce their food consumption in order to ensure their children have enough food to eat. This statistic has highlighted the extent of the pressure on Canadian households as they battle a complex web of financial difficulties.\n\nThe Salvation Army’s report, which was released on November 21, painted a sobering picture of the struggles many Canadians face in today's economic environment. As per the report, over 90% of those surveyed said they had reduced their grocery spending to free up funds for other financial priorities, such as rent and utility bills. In addition, many families are reportedly being forced to buy cheaper and less nutritious food amidst their battle against rising food prices.\n\nMoreover, around 80% of respondents, during the survey, admitted to skipping meals as a way to cope with the soaring cost of living and feed their children.\n\nCanada Faces Severe Economic Crisis\n\nThe report comes at a time when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce a break on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for some essential items to help ease the issue of affordability in Canada. This is because Canada is facing an affordability crisis leading to parents compromising on their food or essential needs to take care of their financial obligations.\n\nThis is also at a time when food banks in Canada are also facing a shortage and some of them decided to turn away international students, which might include Indians, pointing towards the fact that Canada is facing a severe economic crisis.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that a developed country like Canada is facing all these difficulties at a time when the country is heading for the general election next year.\n\nAccording to John Murray, a spokesperson for the Salvation Army, the findings of the report reflect a \"deep, deep crisis\" in the country. \"The reality is that many Canadians continue to have trouble meeting their daily basic needs for themselves and, much more importantly, for their children and their family members,\" Murray stated.\n\nThe survey of families across the nation underscores how many parents are being forced to make difficult choices between food, shelter, and other essentials.\n\nThe crisis is worsened by the ongoing shortages faced by food banks across Canada, which have been stretched to their limits as demand continues to rise. Some food banks have been forced to turn away international students, adding another layer of complexity to the issue of food insecurity in the country. This has raised concerns, particularly as Canada faces its most challenging affordability crisis in decades.\n\nPolitical Pressure Mounts on Trudeau\n\nThe timing of the Salvation Army’s report coincides with increased political pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to take action to address the cost-of-living crisis. Trudeau is expected to announce a temporary break on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for essential items such as clothing, nappies, and pre-made hot meals. The measure is seen as a response to growing demands for relief from rising costs, with many hoping that it will ease the burden on struggling households.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), has voiced his support for the measure, though he criticized it as insufficient. \"It’s far from the substantial and permanent relief the NDP wants to give Canadians,\" Singh said. \"The Liberals are letting people down with their choice to make this a short-term tax holiday, on only some items.\"",

		"text": "Moscow: Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Thursday, issued a stark warning to Western nations, saying that Moscow could target the military installations of those countries, which are supporting Ukraine and whose weapons were used against Russia. The threat follows a recent escalation in the ongoing conflict, marked by Russia's launch of a hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian military facility.\n\nPutin’s remarks were made in the context of growing tensions between Russia and the West, with NATO countries providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry. The Russian president condemned the West for what he described as the continued escalation of the war by enabling Ukraine to strike Russian territory with long-range missiles, thereby expanding the conflict into a more global issue.\n\nThe latest development has also come up after US President Joe Biden’s grant to Ukraine allowing them to use long-range missiles and weapons provided by the United States in strikes against Russia.\n\nRussia Responds with Hypersonic Missile Strike\n\nRussian President Putin highlighted that in retaliation to the use of American and British long-range weapons by Ukraine, Russia had carried out a significant military action on November 21. The Russian military launched a combined strike on a Ukrainian military-industrial complex, marking a sharp escalation in the conflict. He also confirmed that during this operation, Russia had conducted combat tests of its new \"Oreshnik\" (Hazel) hypersonic missile system, one of the latest additions to Russia's missile arsenal.\n\n\"In response to the use of American and British long-range weapons, on November 21 of this year, the Russian armed forces launched a combined strike on one of the facilities of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine,\" Putin stated, referring to the strike on Ukrainian infrastructure.",

Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.\" His withdrawal came a day after meeting with senators to seek their support for his confirmation as head of the Justice Department.\n\nTaking to social media X, Gaetz explained that while he had received strong support and feedback from senators, he felt his confirmation was becoming a distraction.\n\nGaetz’s decision to step aside comes amid a swirl of controversy surrounding his nomination, marking a significant setback in the transition process for Trump's legal team.\n\nGaetz also expressed his continued commitment to ensuring that Trump’s presidency is successful. “I remain fully committed to seeing that Donald J.

		"title": "Putin Claims Test of New Missile, Warns of Escalation Amid Growing Tensions with Ukraine",
		"text": "Kyiv: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has tested a new intermediate range missile in a strike on Ukraine on Thursday, and warned that Moscow could use it against countries that have allowed Kyiv to use their missiles to strike Russia. Putin said in a nationwide TV address that the Russian strike on Ukraine on Thursday came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with US and British missiles earlier this week.\n\nRussia's Warning to the West\n\nThe Russian leader declared that Russia would issue advance warnings before strikes on other countries to allow civilians to evacuate to safety. He warned that US air defence systems wouldn't be capable of intercepting Russian missiles.\n\nUkraine claimed on Thursday that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at one of its cities, but American officials said an initial US assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Ukraine did not provide any evidence that an ICBM was used in the attack on the central city of Dnipro, apparently armed with conventional warheads.\n\nDisagreement Over Missile Type\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a missile used “matches the speed and altitude” of an ICBM. The Kremlin refused to comment on the strike. But an initial US assessment shows the strike came from an intermediate-range ballistic missile, not an ICBM, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. A third US official also said it did not appear to be an ICBM.\n\nA Week of Rising Tensions\n\nThe attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the US eased restrictions on Ukraine's use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons. The range of an ICBM — which can exceed 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) — is beyond what is needed to attack Ukraine. But such missiles are designed to carry atomic warheads, and the use of one, even with a conventional payload, would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia's nuclear capability. It also appears to send a message to Ukraine's Western allies that Moscow has the ability to target them.\n\nIf confirmed, it would be the first time Moscow has used such a weapon in the war. In a statement Thursday on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine's air force said an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired at Dnipro, along with eight other missiles, and that the Ukrainian military shot down six of them. Two people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation centre for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials.\n\nZelenskyy's Response to the Attack\n\nThe air force statement said it was launched from Russia's Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. “Today, our crazy neighbour once again showed what he really is,” Zelenskyy said. “And how afraid he is.” UK officials did not immediately confirm what kind of missile Russia fired. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman, Dave Pares, called the reports “deeply concerning” but added that intelligence services were still looking into them.\n\n“If true, clearly this would be another example of grave, reckless and escalatory behavior from Russia and only serves to strengthen our resolve,” he said. Defence Secretary John Healey said there were “unconfirmed reports … of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine, which we know they have been preparing for months.” Ballistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 500 kilometers (310 miles) to over 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) in the case of intercontinental ones. “Ballistic” refers to the shape of their trajectory.\n\nSince the Cold War era, Moscow and Washington have given each other advance notice about ICBM launches to prevent the other side from perceiving a test launch as a nuclear attack. They have stuck to exchanging such warnings despite increasing tensions — which ratcheted up again in recent days.\n\nEscalation of Military Moves and Responses\n\nEarlier this week, the Biden administration authorised Ukraine to use US-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow. Days later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\n\nNuclear Rhetoric and Western Reactions\n\nThe doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the US, said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behaviour throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations. They have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy’s Home City Attacked\n\nAlso Thursday, Russia also struck Zelenskyy's home city of Kryvyi Rih, wounding 26 people, said the head of regional administration, Serhii Lysak. The missile strike caused damage to an administrative building, at least five multi-story residential buildings, and civilian vehicles.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that its air defence systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets, and 67 drones. The statement didn't say when or where the Storm Shadows were shot down or what they were targeting. Russia earlier reported downing some of the missiles over the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nMore than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes. Analysts and observers say that the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare.\n\nPutin's Warning to NATO",

		"text": "President Putin has claimed that there are currently no countermeasures for the Oreshnik missile, making it a significant addition to Russia's military arsenal | Image: Republic\n\nMoscow: Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during an attack on Ukraine, marking the first use of such powerful, nuclear-capable weapon amid the ongoing war between the two nations, Reuters reported quoting the Ukrainian Air Force.\n\n'Oreshnik' means Hazelnut Tree\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said the missile is named ‘Oreshnik,’ which in Russian means ‘hazelnut tree,' and the launch at Ukraine is the first combat test of it that ‘has gone successfully.’\n\nHighly Difficult to Intercept, Speed of 12,300 km/h\n\nThe Oreshnik is a hypersonic missile, capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 10 (12,300 km/h or 7,610 mph). The missile is designed to be highly difficult to intercept and can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads.\n\nIntermediate-range missiles, or IRBMs, can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Ukrainian military officials said the missile was launched from the Russian region of Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea, 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east.\n\nWhile Russia has launched cruise missiles at Ukraine from even longer ranges, the new intermediate range missile marked the first such use of this kind of ground-launched ballistic missile, which can carry a much heavier conventional payload and could also be fitted with multiple nuclear warheads.\n\n'No Countermeasures': Putin\n\nRussian President Putin has claimed that there are currently no countermeasures for the Oreshnik missile, making it a significant addition to Russia's military arsenal.\n\nPutin boasted that the missile, the latest in Russia’s arsenal of hypersonic weapons, reaches its target at speeds of Mach 10, rendering Western missile defenses useless.\n\nHe said the missile was capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even though they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nVideo of the strike showed six fiery trails followed by powerful explosions -– an apparent sign of the multiple warheads being used.

		"text": "New Delhi: A day after the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) dismissed a Canadian media report highlighting PM Modi's role in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Canada has issued a statement denying any role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in its ‘internal matters’. This statement comes amid the ongoing India-Canada Row over diplomatic issues.\n\nCanada Denies PM Modi, Jaishankar's Role in ‘Internal Matters’\n\nA day after India called out Canada's ‘smear campaign’ against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the country, the Deputy Clerk of the Privy Council and National Security and Intelligence Advisor to the Prime Minister, Nathalie G. Drouin has issued a statement on behalf of the nation.\n\nThe statement by the Justin Trudeau government reads, “On October 14th, because of a significant and ongoing threat to public safety, the RCMP and officials took the extraordinary step of making public accusations of serious criminal activity in Canada perpetrated by agents of the Government of India.”\n\nThe statement further read, \"The Government of Canada has not stated, nor is it aware of evidence, linking Prime Minister Modi, Minister Jaishankar, or NSA Doval to the serious criminal activity within Canada. Any suggestion to the contrary is both speculative and inaccurate.”\n\nTrudeau Govt's Statement After India Calls Out Canada On ‘Smear Campaign’\n\nThis statement by the Justin Trudeau government comes a day after India called out Canada for its ‘smear campaign’ against the nation. Local media reports had claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi already knew about the alleged plot to kill Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Not only this, the reports further claimed that apart from him, India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval were also aware of this plot. The report also mentioned that Canada doesn't have evidence regarding the same yet.\n\nQuoting the report, “While Canada does not have direct evidence that Mr. Modi knew, the official said, the assessment is that it would be unthinkable that three senior political figures in India would not have discussed the targeted killings with Mr. Modi before proceeding.”\n\nOfficial Statement by India Condemned ‘Ludicrous' Claims\n\nTerming the statements given to the Canadian newspaper, purportedly by a Canadian government source, as \"smear campaigns\", MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that India generally doesn't comment on media reports but given the nature of the statement, they should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve.\n\nHe added that that campaigns will further damage the already strained ties between the two nations. \"We do not normally comment on media reports. However, such ludicrous statements made to a newspaper purportedly by a Canadian government source should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Smear campaigns like this only further damage our already strained ties,\" said MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar Killing\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist by India, was shot dead in Surrey in Canada's British Columbia province, in June 2023, kickstarting a diplomatic row after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused \"agents\" of Delhi of being involved in the alleged plot.\n\nNijjar - the chief of banned terror outfit Khalistan Tiger Force - was on Delhi's list of 'most wanted' terrorists for multiple crimes, including the murder of a Hindu priest in Punjab . Anti-terror agency NIA had offered a Rs 10 lakh reward for information leading to his capture. He was gunned down by two armed men in Punjabi-dominated Surrey city of British Columbia province.\n\nNijjar was associated with the separatist organisation, Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which was banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for anti-India activities by the government of India in 2019. Taking cognisance of his several terrorist activities in Punjab, the Indian government had earlier asked Canadian officials to take action against him. Due to his association with violent activities, the Indian government officially labelled him as a 'wanted terrorist.' Nijjar's name prominently featured among the 40 individuals designated as terrorists in the government's most recent release in 2020.\n\nIndia-Canada Row Over Diplomatic Issues\n\nThe India-Canada relations further hit rock bottom last month after Ottawa linked Indian High Commissioner in Canada Sanjay Verma and some other top diplomats to the murder. Canada alleged the high commissioner and other diplomats were \"a person of interest\" in the Nijjar murder probe. New Delhi has vehemently denied any involvement, dismissing the claims made by Ottawa as baseless and politically motivated.\n\nCiting security concerns, the Indian govt recalled high commissioner Verma along with other diplomats. Further, the MEA expelled six Canadian diplomats, including the deputy high commissioner and acting high commissioner. However, the Canadian government had claimed that the Indian diplomats were expelled from the country.",

		"title": "Alabama Carries Out Nation's Third Nitrogen Gas Execution On Man For Hitchhiker's Killing",
		"text": "Atmore: An Alabama man convicted in the 1994 killing of a hitchhiker cursed at the prison warden and made obscene gestures with his hands shortly before he was put to death Thursday evening in the nation's third execution using nitrogen gas.\n\nCarey Dale Grayson, 50, was executed at the William C Holman Correctional Facility in southern Alabama. He was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie DeBlieux, 37, as she hitchhiked through the state on the way to her mother's home in Louisiana. The woman was attacked, beaten and thrown off a cliff.\n\nAlabama began using nitrogen gas earlier this year to carry out some executions. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.\n\nAlabama Corrections Commissioner John Q Hamm said the nitrogen flowed for 15 minutes and an electrocardiogram showed Grayson no longer had a heartbeat about 10 minutes after the gas began flowing.\n\nLike two others previously executed by nitrogen, Grayson shook at times before taking a periodic series of gasping breaths.\n\nThe victim's daughter told reporters afterward that her mother had her future stolen from her. But she also spoke out against the decision to execute Grayson and “murdering inmates under the guise of justice”.\n\nThe curtains to the execution room were opened shortly after 6 pm. Strapped to a gurney with a blue-rimmed gas mask on his face, Grayson responded with an obscenity when the warden asked if he had any final words. Prison officials turned off the microphone. Grayson appeared to speak toward the witness room where state officials were present, but his words could not be heard. He raised both middle fingers at the start of the execution.\n\nIt was unclear when the gas began flowing. Grayson rocked his head, shook and pulled against the gurney restraints. He clenched his fist and appeared to struggle to try to gesture again. His sheet-wrapped legs lifted off the gurney into the air at 6:14 pm. He took a periodic series of more than a dozen gasping breaths for several minutes. He appeared to stop breathing at 6:21 pm, and then the curtains to the viewing room were closed at 6:27 pm.\n\nGrayson was pronounced dead at 6:33 pm.\n\nDeBlieux's mutilated body was found at the bottom of a bluff near Odenville, Alabama, on Feb 26, 1994. She was hitchhiking from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to her mother's home in West Monroe, Louisiana, when the four teens offered her a ride. Prosecutors said the teens took her to a wooded area and attacked and beat her. They returned to mutilate her body.\n\nA medical examiner testified that her face was so fractured that she was identified by an earlier X-ray of her spine. Investigators said the teens were identified as suspects after one of them showed a friend one of DeBlieux's severed fingers and boasted about the killing.\n\nDeBlieux's daughter Jodi Haley spoke with reporters at the media center on prison property after the execution. Haley was 12 when her mother was killed, She said her mother had her life and future stolen from her.\n\n\"She was unique. She was spontaneous. She was wild. She was funny. She was gorgeous to boot,” Haley said of her mother.\n\nShe said Grayson was abused in every possible way in his youth but “society failed this man as a child, and my family suffered because of it.” “Murdering inmates under the guise of justice needs to stop,” she said, adding that \"no one should have the right to take a person's possibilities, days, and life.\" Governor Kay Ivey said afterward she was praying for the victim's loved ones to find closure and healing.\n\n“Some thirty years ago, Vicki DeBlieux's journey to her mother's house and ultimately, her life, were horrifically cut short because of Carey Grayson and three other men,\" Ivey said in a statement. “She sensed something was wrong, attempted to escape, but instead, was brutally tortured and murdered.” Grayson's crimes \"were heinous, unimaginable, without an ounce of regard for human life and just unexplainably mean. An execution by nitrogen hypoxia (bears) no comparison to the death and dismemberment Ms. DeBlieux experienced,” she added.\n\nGrayson was the only one of the four teenagers who faced a death sentence since the other teens were under 18 at the time of the killing. Grayson was 19.\n\nThe execution was carried out hours after the US Supreme Court turned down Grayson's request for a stay. His final appeals had focused on a call for more scrutiny of the nitrogen gas method. His lawyers argued the execution method causes “conscious suffocation” and that the first two nitrogen executions did not result in swift unconsciousness and death as the state had promised.\n\nHamm said he thought some of Grayson's initial movements were “all show” but maintained other movements exhibited by Grayson and the two others executed by nitrogen gas were expected involuntary movements, including the breathing at the end.\n\nNo state other than Alabama has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state - along with Oklahoma and Mississippi - to authorise the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.",

		"title": "UN Nuclear Agency's Board Condemns Iran for 2nd Time in 5 Months for Non-Cooperation",
		"text": "Vienna: The UN nuclear watchdog's board on Thursday condemned Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency, the second time it has done so in just five months.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency also called on Tehran to provide answers in a long-running investigation into uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.\n\nNineteen members of the IAEA board voted for the resolution, while Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed it, and 12 abstained and one did not vote, according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote.\n\nThe resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain, supported by the United States. It comes at a critical time, ahead of Donald Trump 's return to the White House.\n\nTrump's first term in office was marked by a particularly tense period with Iran, when the US president pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” against Tehran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, and imposed even harsher sanctions that have since hobbled Iran's economy further.\n\nThe resolution comes on the heels of a confidential report earlier this week in which the IAEA said Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear programme and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.\n\nThat report, seen by the AP on Tuesday, said that as of October 26, Iran has accumulated 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last IAEA report in August. Uranium enriched at 60 per cent purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent.\n\nThe resolution approved on Thursday requires the IAEA to now produce a “comprehensive and updated assessment” of Iran's nuclear activities, which could eventually trigger a referral to the UN Security Council to consider more sanctions on Tehran.\n\nIn a joint statement issued after the approval of the resolution, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the passing of the resolution, saying that Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders to launch new and advanced centrifuges, powerful machines that spin rapidly to enrich uranium.\n\nIn the past, the IAEA has named two locations near Tehran — Varamin and Turquzabad — where there have been traces of processed uranium, according to IAEA inspectors. Thursday's resolution honed in on those locations, asking Tehran to provide “technically credible explanations” for the presence of the uranium particles at the sites.\" The IAEA has urged Iran to also provide answers about the origin and current location of that nuclear material in order for it “to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.” Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons programme until at least 2003. Tehran insists its programme is peaceful.\n\nOne of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant.\n\nIran denied that, though IAEA inspectors later found the man-made uranium particles there.\n\nWhile the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions.\n\nOn the subject of Varamin, the IAEA said that inspectors believe Iran used the site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form, which then can be enriched through spinning in a centrifuge. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004.\n\nTurquzabad, the second location, is where the IAEA believes Iran brought some of the material from Varamin amid the demolition, though it said that alone cannot “explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles” found there.\n\nThursday's resolution before the 35-member board at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, called on Tehran to explain the presence of the uranium particles at Varamin and Turquzabad, inform the UN nuclear watchdog about the current whereabouts of that nuclear material, and grant access to IAEA inspectors to all Iranian nuclear locations.\n\nA draft of the resolution was seen by the AP.\n\nTehran continues to maintain that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and has told the IAEA that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under a so-called Safeguard Agreement it has with the IAEA.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Tehran although Iranian officials have vowed to retaliate immediately if a resolution is passed. In the past, Tehran has responded to IAEA resolutions by stepping up its nuclear activities.\n\nThe resolution also requires IAEA director general Rafael Grossi to provide an updated assessment of Iran's nuclear programme — including the possible presence of undeclared nuclear material at the two locations — by spring 2025 at the latest.\n\nThe assessment could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, diplomats said, leading to potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. It could also provide a basis for European countries to trigger sanctions against Iran ahead of October 2025, when the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal expires, the diplomats said.",

		"title": "Death Toll in Gaza From Israel-Hamas War Passes 44,000, Palestinian Officials Say",
		"text": "Deir al-Balah: The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nThe Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nThe Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90 per cent of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure.\n\nPalestinian officials and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the United Nations' top court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. The Israeli government adamantly denies the allegations, accusing critics of being biased against it.\n\nIn recent weeks, the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has plummeted, prompting the United States to threaten to reduce its military support for Israel before backing down, citing limited progress. Experts have warned that isolated, war-ravaged northern Gaza could already be experiencing famine.\n\nThe United States, Egypt and Qatar spent months trying to broker a cease-fire agreement in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Those talks ground to a halt over the summer, with Israel and Hamas each accusing the other of making unacceptable demands.",

		"text": "Ruling parties held sway in most of the 13 states in the assembly byelection results declared on Saturday, with the BJP and its allies wresting seats in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan and the Trinamool Congress sweeping West Bengal.\n\nOut of the 46 seats where byelections were held, the BJP and its allies won 26, a gain of nine seats, followed by Congress with seven -- a loss of six seats. The Trinamool Congress won six, the Aam Aadmi Party three and the Samajwadi Party two seats. The LDF in Kerala and BAP in Rajasthan got one each.\n\nApart from this, two seats in Sikkim were won unopposed by Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM).\n\nIn the bypolls to two Lok Sabha constituencies, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi cruised to her maiden electoral victory from Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala with a margin of over 4.1 lakh votes against CPI(M)-led LDF's Sathyan Mokeri. The party also won Nanded in Maharashtra by a narrow margin after recounting of votes.\n\nAfter the reverses in the Lok Sabha election, the ruling BJP-led alliance secured its hold over the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh with its candidates winning seven out of nine seats. The BJP retained four seats -- Ghaziabad, Khair, Majhawan and Phulpur -- and wrested Katehari and Kundarki from the SP while its ally RLD retained one. The Samajwadi Party, which had four of these seats, retained Sishamau and Karhal.\n\nThe BJP termed the byelection results as a defeat of divisive forces.\n\nChief Minister Yogi Adityanath said it was a testament to the people's unwavering faith in the successful leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"This victory is the result of the security, good governance and public welfare policies of the double-engine government and the tireless hard work of dedicated workers,\" Adityanath said on X.\n\nHowever, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav termed the Uttar Pradesh bypolls the \"most distorted form of electoral politics\".\n\nThe Muslim-dominated Kundarki assembly had not been won by the BJP since 1993, while it was the party's first win since 1991 in Katehari.\n\nThe ruling BJP won five of the seven seats in Rajasthan, wresting three from Congress and one from the RLP. The Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) and the Congress retained one seat each.\n\nIn a boost to the Bhagwant Mann-led government, the ruling AAP in Punjab wrested Gidderbaha, Dera Baba Nanak and Chabbewal assembly segments from the Congress, which ousted AAP from Barnala.\n\nAmong the prominent losers was former Punjab finance minister and BJP candidate Manpreet Singh Badal (Gidderbaha). Punjab Congress chief and Ludhiana MP Amrinder Singh Raja Warring's wife Amrita (Gidderbha) and Gurdaspur MP Sukhjinder Randhawa's wife Jatinder Kaur (Dera Baba Nanak) lost from seats which were considered their strongholds.\n\nThe ruling NDA in Bihar swept the bypolls to four assembly segments, retaining Imamganj (HAM) and wresting from the INDIA bloc Tarari (BJP), Ramgarh (BJP) and Belaganj (JD-U), receiving a boost ahead of the assembly elections due next year.\n\nCandidates of the Jan Suraaj, floated recently by former political strategist Prashant Kishor with much fanfare, lost deposits in all but one seat.\n\nRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, whose party has now lost the status of the single largest party in the assembly, played down the results and claimed that the Mahagathbandhan, the INDIA bloc's Bihar prototype, was all set to win the 2025 assembly elections.\n\nThe TMC trounced the opposition in West Bengal, retaining five seats and wresting Madarihat from the BJP, further cementing its political dominance in the state despite the the ongoing protests over the RG Kar incident.\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the results of the byelections would help her work for the people.\n\n\"I would like to thank and congratulate the 'Maa, Mati and Manush' from the bottom of my heart. Your blessings will help us work for the people in the coming days. We all are common people and that is our identity. We are not zamindars, but the custodians of the people,\" she posted on X.\n\nNot just BJP, the TMC also defeated its INDIA bloc allies, the Left Front and the Congress, with huge margins in the Haroa and Sitai seats with all rival candidates losing their security deposits.\n\nThe ruling National People's Party (NPP) in Meghalaya - an ally of NDA - also got a boost as Chief Minister Conrad Sangma's wife Mehtab Chandee Agitok Sangma wrested the Gambegre seat from the Congress.\n\nThe Congress won the byelections to all three assembly seats in Karnataka, wresting one each from the BJP and its ally JD(S). In Kerala, it retained the Palakkad assembly seat while the ruling LDF maintained its hold in Chelakkara assembly seat.\n\nGiving credit to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's leadership as well as the five guarantees for the Congress party’s success, Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said it was a prelude to the 2028 assembly election where the party would once again win.\n\nThe BJP along with its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United Peoples' Party Liberal (UPPL) won all five assembly constituencies in Assam.\n\nThe AGP and UPPL retained the Bongaigaon and Sidli (ST) constituencies, respectively. The BJP retained Behali and Dholai (SC), and wrested Samaguri from the Congress.\n\nThe ruling BJP wrested the Vav assembly constituency in Gujarat from the Congress and retained the Raipur City South assembly seat in Chattisgarh and Kedarnath assembly seat in Uttarakhand.\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, BJP retained the Budhni seat, where byelection was necessitated following the resignation of former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, but suffered a setback as state minister Ramniwas Rawat lost in the Vijaypur assembly seat with the Congress retaining the seat.\n\nRawat had won the seat on a Congress ticket in the 2023 assembly polls but then switched over to the BJP, which made him forest minister in the Mohan Yadav government. He had won from Vijaypur in Sheopur district as a Congress candidate in 1990, 1993, 2003, 2008 and 2013 as well.\n\nSikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) candidates Aditya Golay and Satish Chandra Rai were on Saturday elected unopposed in the bypolls to Soreng-Chakung and Namchi-Singhithang assembly constituencies, officials said.",

And I am supposed to be obsessed with him.” For the unversed, this is not the first time the actress had cold wars with her co-stars.

This result was a stark contrast to the predictions made by many of its senior leaders, who had claimed that the alliance would defeat the Mahayuti.\n\nFall of Uddhav?\n\nThackeray said the results reflect that there was a tsunami rather than a wave.\n\n“We will keep fighting for the rights of Maharashtra,” Thackeray said.\n\nOf the 95 seats it contested, the Sena (UBT) was winning or leading in just 20 seats. By contrast, Uddhav's archrival Shinde, who split the Bal Thackeray-founded Shiv Sena in 2022, powered his outfit to an emphatic show.

We as students demand that the exams be held on a single day just like before.\" \"The commission says it can conduct these exams only at the government schools in 41 districts because it has limited number of centres. It is unfortunate that the commission has only one responsibility (of conducting the exams) and it has failed in that as well. Why can't the exams be held in a single day across all the districts,\" Tripathi asked.\n\nAnother protester, Manorama Singh, claimed the commission’s decision to conduct the exams on two days goes against the rules.\n\n\"In the notification, the commission did not mention that the exams will be held on two days. The students want them to be completed in a single day,\" Singh said.\n\nAnkit Patel, one of the agitating aspirants, also said the students want the exams to be held in a single shift just like before.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (City) Abhishek Bharti told reporters, \"The aspirants and students have been requested to go to the designated dharna spot in the church area under the Civil Lines police station to stage their protest in a peaceful and democratic manner. Their point of view will be conveyed to the higher officials.\" \"Many students have already gone there, but some of them are still protesting in front of the commission office,\" the DCP said.\n\nMeanwhile, condemning the police \"highhandedness\", Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav termed the BJP government in the state \"anti-youth\" and \"anti-student\".\n\nIn a statement issued by the party, Yadav claimed when the candidates raised the demand to stop \"rigging\" in UPPCS exams in Prayagraj, the \"corrupt\" BJP government turned violent.\n\n\"The BJP does not intend to give jobs to the youth. Jobs and employment are not part of their agenda. It has betrayed the youth with their anti-youth policies. But the Samajwadi Party is with the youth and the students and supports their demands,\" Yadav said in the statement.\n\n\"The democratic rights of the students and the youth are being snatched away under the dictatorship of the Yogi (Adityanath) government,\" he added.",

The KEA has submitted this proposal to the Karnataka e-Governance department.\n\n\"The e-Governance department is in favour of our proposal and they have sent a proposal to the Government of India for approval. We are awaiting the approval soon,\" said KEA Executive Director H Prasanna.\n\n\"Aadhaar-linked registration is proposed to ensure authentication which was not there so far, to prevent any mischief in the registration, and also ensure dissemination of exam-related information to students on their mobile phones,\" he said.\n\nThere are also plans to also introduce Aadhaar-linked registration to recruitment exams KEA conducts for various departments, to curb impersonation and other malpractices, Prasanna said.\n\nThe move by the KEA comes in the wake of an alleged seat-blocking scam coming to light, under the Karnataka Common Entrance Test (KCET) quota, after completion of all the rounds of engineering seat allotment.\n\nIt was found that several students had blocked seats using the same IP address and that mobile numbers and email ids they provided to KEA were fake or wrong.\n\nAccording to officials, it was found that in some cases students who opted for seats in sought-after streams at top colleges, did not report to the colleges, which could result in all such seats that were under KCET quota falling into the management quota.",

According to recent data, Australia has become an increasingly popular destination for Indian students, with numbers recovering post-COVID to reach over 122,000 Indian students in 2024.

		"text": "Bhumi Pednekar went down memory lane as she talked about her debut film “Dum Laga Ke Haisha” and said that she became an actor in a time where the way she looked was secondary.\n\n“Dum Laga Ke Haisha”, which released in 2015, was directed by Sharat Katariya. The film also stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Sanjay Mishra and Seema Pahwa. The film told the story of a school dropout named Prem, who hesitantly marries an educated but overweight girl, Sandhya. However, the two come closer when they take part in a race, which involves Prem carrying Sandhya on his back\n\n“‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha’ is a very special film not just to me, but also the film connected so deeply with people that it’s still the first thing they come and tell me—that we loved you in Dum Laga Ke Haisha. That’s truly very special.”\n\nThe film broke stereotypes with its authentic storytelling and questioned beauty standards. Bhumi added, “I think the film is special for all the reasons that have truly questioned the status quo. I think through my work I’m constantly trying to do that.”\n\nThe 35-year-old actress said that she was taken by surprise when she did the film.\n\n“Even when Dum Laga Ke Haisha happened, I was so pleasantly surprised because I was like, here is a Hindi film heroine in a Yash Raj movie who is not going to look like any of the girls that they have cast in their films before,” she said.\n\nFor Bhumi, the film’s success proved that talent is more important than appearance.\n\n“I fortunately became an actor in a time where the way I looked was secondary and what I gave on screen was primary. And I’m so, so fortunate to have had all these opportunities and just the platform.”",

		"title": "Breaking Down Indian Army’s Ambush Tactics in Terrain-Driven Warfare in Kashmir and the Northeast",
		"text": "COIN operations are divided into Hasty and Deliberate Ambushes, both designed to neutralize terrorist groups and insurgents but differing in execution. | Image: Republic/ADGPI\n\nIndian Army's Ambush Tactics in COIN Ops\n\nNew Delhi, India - Ambush tactics have been a critical component of the Indian Army's counterinsurgency operations (COIN) in both Kashmir and the Northeast. These strategies leverage terrain, surprise, and precision to neutralize adversaries, including terrorist groups and insurgents. While the overarching principles remain consistent, the execution and adaptation of these tactics vary significantly between the two regions due to differences in geography, insurgent strategies, and operational challenges.\n\nAmbush tactics fall into two broad categories based on the time available for preparation and the operational intent: Hasty Ambushes and Deliberate Ambushes. Both are fundamental to military strategy, but their execution and objectives differ significantly.\n\nHasty Ambush\n\nA rapidly executed ambush is initiated when a patrol unit unexpectedly encounters an enemy force and has the element of surprise. These are time-sensitive and require minimal preparation time. Hasty Ambushes rely on the team's training and instincts.\n\nThese ambushes are adaptable to sudden encounters in dynamic operational environments. Execution depends on the readiness and discipline of the patrol unit.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nCapitalizes on unanticipated opportunities.\n\nLeverages the enemy’s lack of preparedness.\n\nLimitations:\n\nHigher risk of mistakes due to the lack of detailed planning.\n\nLimited scope for reinforcements or contingency actions.\n\nExample Use:\n\nA Quick Reaction Team (QRT) in Kashmir encountering terrorists during a patrol might quickly establish a hasty ambush to neutralize the threat before it escapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeliberate Ambush\n\nA carefully planned and coordinated attack is set up in advance to intercept and engage an enemy force at a specific location and time.\n\nThese ambushes involve reconnaissance, site selection, and preparation well in advance. Detailed planning ensures that every element is synchronized. These are designed to trap the enemy in a prearranged kill zone.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nHigh success rate due to preparation and coordination.\n\nAllows integration of multiple force elements and advanced equipment.\n\nLimitations:\n\nRelies on accurate intelligence; any deviation by the enemy can render the ambush ineffective.\n\nTime-intensive and resource-heavy.\n\nExample Use:\n\nOperation Sarp Vinash (2003): The Indian Army used deliberate ambushes to flush out heavily armed militants entrenched in the Pir Panjal Range of Kashmir.\n\n1) Linear Ambush\n\nAttackers align parallel to the enemy’s route, targeting a convoy or column with maximum firepower along its length. Open areas like roads, trails, or pathways with clear visibility.\n\nLinear Ambush requires a simplistic setup and execution. These are effective for engaging multiple targets simultaneously.\n\nHowever, these offer a limited element of surprise from the sides and can prove ineffective in dense vegetation or obstructed terrain.\n\nUse in Operations\n\nIn Kashmir, linear ambushes target infiltrators or small terrorist groups using roads or trails in rugged mountain passes.\n\nIn the Northeast, this tactic is applied along trails near riverbanks or open areas to ambush insurgent movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2) L-shaped Ambush\n\nOne firing line runs parallel to the enemy’s movement, while another runs perpendicular, creating a lethal crossfire. L-shaped ambushes are effective in intersections, river bends, or chokepoints.\n\nThis tactic offers enfilade fire along the column and confusion from multidirectional attacks and can be adapted to varied terrains.\n\nHowever, these ambushes require precise coordination to avoid gaps in fire coverage.\n\nUse in Operations:\n\nIn Kashmir, these are employed at high-altitude passes to intercept militants moving between hideouts.\n\nIn the Northeast, L-shaped ambushes trap insurgents in jungle clearings or intersecting trails.\n\n3) V-shaped Ambush\n\nAttackers form a “V,” channelling the enemy into the apex, where concentrated fire inflicts maximum casualties. Narrow valleys, gorges, or funnel-like areas with dense vegetation offer some of the best terrain for carrying out such ambushes.\n\nV-shaped ambushes are highly effective in trapping and neutralizing adversaries. Such an ambush creates a lethal crossfire at the apex.\n\nHowever, the execution of such ambushes depends on precise coordination. Furthermore, they are vulnerable if detected prematurely.\n\nUse in Operations:\n\nIn the Northeast, dense forests and confined spaces make V-shaped ambushes effective against insurgent groups.\n\nIn Kashmir, this formation is less common but used in mountain passes with restricted enemy movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparison: Kashmir vs. Northeast Operations\n\nIn Kashmir, ambushes target small groups of terrorists infiltrating from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) or moving between hideouts. Rugged and open terrain demands well-concealed, static ambushes, often supported by advanced surveillance tools such as UAVs and thermal imagers.\n\nIn the Northeast, insurgents are ambushed during transit or while transporting logistical supplies. The region’s dense forests necessitate dynamic and adaptive ambush tactics, with operations often stretching over extended periods.",

		"title": "India Gears Up for Pan-India Coastal Defence Exercise with Troops from Army, Navy, and Air Force",
		"text": "New Delhi, India - The Indian Navy is preparing for the fourth edition of its prestigious coastal defence exercise, Ex Sea Vigil-24, which is set to take place on November 20 and 21, 2024. This Pan-India exercise is being conducted with an unprecedented scale and participation, showcasing India's commitment to strengthening its coastal security and defence infrastructure. The exercise will cover the entire Indian coastline and its vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), involving numerous agencies and organisations in a coordinated effort to safeguard India’s maritime boundaries.\n\nEx Sea Vigil-24 will be the largest edition of the exercise, marking significant advancements in both its geographical reach and the scale of participation. For the first time, six key ministries and 21 different organisations/agencies will be involved in the exercise, making it a truly national-level initiative. These include the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, Indian Coast Guard, Customs, Fisheries, State Marine Police, and other maritime security agencies, alongside personnel from the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). The inclusion of NSCS officials in the Coastal Defence & Security Readiness Evaluation (CDSRE) phase of the exercise, being conducted by the Naval Officer-in-Charge of all coastal states and Union Territories (UTs) since October 2024, marks a critical step towards comprehensive national security integration.\n\nFocus on Coastal Infrastructure and Security\n\nThe exercise is designed to evaluate and enhance the security readiness of India’s critical coastal assets. It will focus on securing vital maritime infrastructure such as ports, oil rigs, Single Point Moorings, cable landing points, and other key facilities essential to India’s economic and strategic interests. Additionally, the exercise will place a significant emphasis on the protection of the coastal population and communities living in proximity to the sea, ensuring their safety and security amidst evolving maritime threats.\n\nThis year, the participation of other services, including the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force, coupled with the deployment of a large number of ships and aircraft, will further elevate the tempo of the exercise. The coordinated efforts of all three services will test India’s ability to defend its vast coastline and respond effectively to any emerging threats.\n\nCoastal Defence & Security Readiness Evaluation\n\nThe ongoing CDSRE phase, which began at the end of October 2024, involves a detailed audit of the entire coastal defence infrastructure. This phase has been spearheaded by the Naval Officer-in-Charge of all coastal states and UTs, including Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, to assess the readiness of India’s coastal security apparatus. Personnel from various agencies, including the Coast Guard, Customs, and State Marine Police, have been working alongside Indian Navy officials to ensure that all coastal defences are in optimal operational condition. The inclusion of the National Security Council Secretariat officials in the teams for the first time highlights the increasing importance of a unified national approach to maritime security.\n\nA significant aspect of Ex Sea Vigil-24 is its aim to engage and raise awareness among India’s coastal communities about the importance of maritime security. The exercise will actively involve the fishing community, coastal populations, and students from the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and Bharat Scouts and Guides. This community involvement is intended to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the military and civilian stakeholders in safeguarding India’s maritime borders. By engaging these communities, the exercise will also encourage vigilance and participation in the larger security framework, which is essential in today’s complex security environment.\n\nA Holistic Appraisal of Maritime Security\n\nWhile coastal security exercises are regularly conducted by individual coastal states and maritime agencies, Ex Sea Vigil stands out as a national-level, integrated initiative led by the Indian Navy. This exercise provides a comprehensive and holistic appraisal of India’s maritime defence and security capabilities, offering a rare opportunity to assess the preparedness of all maritime security agencies in real time. It also serves as a platform to identify gaps, strengths, and areas of improvement in India’s coastal defence structure.\n\n<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">Operational Exercise (TROPEX) | Credit- Indian Navy</span></span>\n\nThe exercise acts as a precursor to the Theatre Level Readiness Operational Exercise (TROPEX), which is conducted biennially by the Indian Navy. By evaluating the readiness of India’s maritime forces, Ex Sea Vigil-24 ensures that the nation is better prepared to address the evolving challenges in the maritime domain, from conventional threats to emerging risks in the form of terrorism, piracy, and natural disasters.",

		"title": "As India, China Begin Coordinated Patrols, Clips of Indian Troops Beating PLA Soldiers Go Viral",
		"text": "Eastern Ladakh, India – In a notable step towards reducing military tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Indian and Chinese armies have initiated weekly coordinated patrols in the strategically significant regions of Demchok and Depsang in Eastern Ladakh. This development follows nearly four years of heightened alertness and negotiations between the two nations after the deadly Galwan Valley clash in June 2020, which marked the most intense border confrontation between India and China in decades.\n\nDefence sources confirm that Indian and Chinese troops successfully completed their first coordinated patrols in early November, a move that comes after an agreement to disengage from Demchok and Depsang, achieved through sustained diplomatic, political, and military talks. This disengagement milestone in late October is being viewed as a significant stride toward stabilizing the region and fostering mutual understanding.\n\nUnder the new agreement, both Indian and Chinese forces will carry out one patrol per week in Demchok and Depsang. Each side will conduct its patrol in its designated area, adhering to stringent coordination protocols. This arrangement is intended to maintain controlled military engagement, avoid misunderstandings, and minimize risks along the LAC. The first patrols conducted under this initiative were overseen by ground commanders, who will continue to engage at regular intervals to ensure the measures are upheld and to address emerging concerns.\n\nVerification Patrols to Confirm Compliance\n\nVerification patrols were also conducted as part of the disengagement terms, ensuring that both sides are adhering to the agreed distance and engagement limits. These verification patrols help build confidence and verify that troops are abiding by the conditions of the disengagement, reducing the possibility of inadvertent provocations that could reignite tensions.\n\nDespite the recent patrol agreements, videos have surfaced on social media showing alleged confrontations between Indian and Chinese soldiers, purportedly depicting an incident where Indian Army personnel detained PLA soldiers within Indian territory. While these videos appear to show the Indian Army apprehending PLA personnel who may have crossed the LAC for reconnaissance, the date and authenticity of the videos remain unverified. While trying to get additional information about the videos, Republic learnt that the clips are from the Arunachal sector and are from around the same time when Galwan clash happened. Furthermore, the uniforms and terrain suggest they may have been recorded in the summer. However, the Indian Army has not officially verified the videos.\n\nA Four-Year Standoff Following the Galwan Valley Clash\n\nThe relationship between India and China has been strained since June 2020, when violent clashes erupted in the Galwan Valley, resulting in casualties on both sides and leading to increased military fortifications along the LAC. The standoff prompted a massive military buildup by both nations, with both sides deploying thousands of additional troops and heavy weaponry to the region, including to critical areas such as Pangong Tso, Hot Springs, and Gogra.\n\nSince the clash, the two countries have engaged in numerous rounds of talks at the diplomatic, military, and political levels to diffuse tensions. The process has been gradual and challenging, with occasional standstills, but recent agreements at Demchok and Depsang reflect a cautious optimism for long-term stability. Analysts see the weekly coordinated patrols as a structured way to ensure ongoing engagement and manage points of friction in real-time.\n\nDiplomatic Efforts Behind the Disengagement\n\nThe recent patrols highlight the impact of high-level diplomatic and political discussions aimed at preventing future conflicts and re-establishing stability along the LAC. Indian and Chinese leaders have met on multiple occasions during international summits to reaffirm their commitment to dialogue and conflict prevention. This political commitment is supported by regular engagements between senior military officials who oversee the implementation of agreements on the ground.\n\nIn a recent statement, a senior Indian defence official described the patrol agreement as “a crucial step toward lasting peace.” He emphasized the importance of “patience, consistency, and commitment” from both sides to make this a sustainable model for future military engagement in sensitive border areas.",

		"title": "India’s Highest Airfield at Mudh-Nyoma Nears Completion Under Indian Army’s Project Himank",
		"text": "Ladakh, India — The Indian Army’s Project Himank has reached a significant milestone with the near-completion of India’s highest airfield at Mudh-Nyoma in Ladakh, close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. Brigadier Vishal Srivastava, Chief Engineer of Project Himank, announced that the airfield is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year, underscoring India’s commitment to bolstering its strategic infrastructure in the region.\n\nAt an altitude of 13,700 feet, the Mudh-Nyoma airfield has been developed to handle heavy military aircraft, including fighter jets, transport planes, and rotary-wing helicopters, making it one of the most formidable aviation hubs in high-altitude warfare. Brigadier Srivastava noted, \"As far as the runway is concerned, it is almost complete. Final touches are being applied, and a joint inspection with the Indian Air Force is scheduled soon. We are optimistic about conducting trial landings by year-end.”\n\nBoosting Strategic and Socio-Economic Potential\n\nThe construction of this high-altitude airfield is a critical development for India’s military readiness and socio-economic landscape in the remote region. The advanced facility, designed to support India’s heaviest military aircraft, will provide enhanced logistical and rapid response capabilities along the LAC, bolstering national security in an area known for its rugged terrain and strategic sensitivity.\n\nBrigadier Srivastava emphasized the local impact, explaining, “This runway will significantly aid not only in terms of military operations but also in boosting the socio-economic conditions of nearby regions, including Hanley, Loma, and Nyoma.” He highlighted that the airfield’s construction aligns with Project Himank’s broader goal of supporting communities through improved infrastructure.\n\nRecord-Breaking Construction\n\nThe airfield’s completion underlines the use of state-of-the-art technology and innovative construction practices adapted to the harsh high-altitude conditions of Ladakh. Temperatures in the region drop to as low as -35 degrees Celsius in winter, limiting the working season to a brief period between May and November. Despite this constraint, the airfield was completed at a record pace, with modern machinery, specialized cold-setting compounds, and quality-control additives ensuring that the construction adhered to stringent standards.\n\n“The foundation stone for this runway was laid by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on August 23, and within a remarkably short timeframe, we are ready for trial operations,” Brigadier Srivastava noted. “This is the highest runway in India, built with the latest construction technologies to withstand the extreme weather, with no compromise on quality or speed.”\n\nEnhancing Military Capabilities Against China\n\nThe new airfield’s operational readiness will further strengthen India’s defence posture in Ladakh, an area marked by strategic importance and a history of tensions with China. Recently, India and China reached a disengagement agreement in Eastern Ladakh’s Depsang and Demchok sectors following extensive discussions across military and diplomatic channels. The completion of the Mudh-Nyoma airfield marks India’s proactive approach to maintaining readiness and strengthening infrastructure along its contested borders.",

		"title": "BLA and BLF Intensify Separatist Offensive, MI Agent Assassinated, Military Posts Attacked",
		"text": "Quetta, Balochistan - In an intense escalation of separatist violence in Pakistan ’s Balochistan province, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for killing Dashti Khan, an alleged operative linked to Pakistan’s Military Intelligence (MI), in Quetta. According to a media statement by BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch on Monday, the assassination took place the previous night. “Our fighters shot and neutralized Dashti Khan, an agent and operative of the Pakistani army’s secret agency, Military Intelligence (MI), in Quetta,” he stated. This targeted killing marks a continuation of the BLA’s campaign against Pakistani state forces and their local affiliates.\n\nThe BLA killed Dashti Khan, linked to Pakistan’s Military Intelligence | Credit- @OsintTV\n\nThe BLA accused Dashti Khan, a resident of Saryab, of active collaboration with Pakistan's intelligence services, including the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), an elite unit responsible for counter-terrorism, intelligence-gathering, and investigations across Pakistan’s provinces. Allegedly, Khan was involved with state-supported “death squads” and had a role in the enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings of Baloch youth. According to the BLA, Khan was sentenced to death by a so-called \"Baloch National Court\" and was subsequently “executed” to fulfill this verdict.\n\nRise in Separatist Attacks: BLF Assault on Pakistani Checkpoint\n\nOn Sunday, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), another freedom group, launched an assault on a Pakistani military checkpoint in Noshki’s Zareen forest. BLF spokesperson Major Gwahram Baloch confirmed that two Pakistani personnel were killed and four others injured in the 20-minute attack involving “heavy, modern weapons.” The BLF, a faction advocating for Baloch independence, also executed multiple attacks on Pakistani military convoys in Kolwah on the same day.\n\nAccording to the BLF, the first ambush occurred around 12:30 PM in the Marastan area, resulting in the deaths of five soldiers. A second assault followed an hour later near Kadday Hotel, reportedly killing four more soldiers and disabling several vehicles through heavy firepower. In a separate attack in Kharan, BLF fighters targeted a construction site associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), setting machinery ablaze. The group reiterated its opposition to what it described as “imperialist projects” encroaching on Baloch land.\n\nAdditional Incidents in Gwadar and Awaran\n\nFurther reports of violence emerged from Gwadar, where unidentified assailants attacked a Pakistan Coast Guard patrol between Ormara and Kalmat, injuring three personnel, including a Major. Those wounded—Major Jalaluddin, Tauseef Umar, and Abrar—were treated in Ormara before being transferred to Karachi. No group has claimed responsibility for this assault.\n\nIn a separate attack in Awaran, unidentified gunmen assaulted Levies personnel in the Gishkor Hoor area, seizing at least ten firearms. While no casualties were reported, the attack signals increasing unrest and brazen resistance from armed groups operating in the region. So far, no group has taken responsibility for this incident.\n\nPakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), previously known as the Crime Investigation Department (CID), operates as a multi-functional unit under the jurisdiction of each provincial police force. With responsibilities spanning crime scene investigation, interrogation, anti-terrorism efforts, and intelligence operations, the CTD collaborates with federal intelligence agencies, including the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). Notably active in Karachi, CTD units work closely with these federal agencies to counter organized crime and dismantle terror cells affiliated with groups such as the TTP, Islamic State, and al-Qaeda. CTD operations are overseen by senior police officials, often Additional Inspector Generals, in coordination with provincial Home Ministries.\n\nThe Implications of Increasing Separatist Attacks\n\nThe wave of violence orchestrated by Baloch freedom groups highlights the region’s deep-seated grievances against the Pakistani government. The BLA’s recent high-profile assassination of an alleged MI operative underscores the organization’s ability to strike at targets they deem collaborators. Meanwhile, BLF's systematic targeting of military assets, convoys, and CPEC-linked projects reveals an intensified strategy to challenge state control over Balochistan’s vast, resource-rich landscape.",

		"text": "Rajouri, India – In an inspiring story of grit and determination, seven girls from the South of Pir Panjal region have earned their spots in the Jammu and Kashmir state volleyball team, set to compete at the national level. Trained under the mentorship of the Indian Army, these young athletes have proven their mettle on the court, showcasing exceptional skill and sportsmanship.\n\nTheir achievement reflects not only their own dedication but also the transformative role of the Indian Army’s volleyball coaching initiative, which has emerged as a game-changer for girls in this remote and underdeveloped region.\n\nFrom Local Talent to National Recognition\n\nThe journey began on August 29, 2024, when the Indian Army launched its volleyball coaching program in Rajouri and Poonch districts, bringing together 30 enthusiastic girls. With the help of seasoned coaches from J&K’s sports authorities and physiotherapists, the Army rolled out a structured training module focusing on fundamental skills, game strategies, and physical fitness.\n\nThe program’s results speak volumes:\n\n19 girls advanced to district-level competitions across three categories: U-14, U-17, and U-19.\n\n15 of these players represented Jammu Division in state-level trials.\n\n7 players were ultimately selected to represent J&K at national tournaments.\n\nOf these seven, three will compete in the U-19 category, one in U-17, and three in U-14, marking a proud milestone for the region.\n\nFor many of these girls, stepping onto the volleyball court was a first—challenging societal norms that often restrict women’s participation in sports. Supported by the Indian Army, the program has provided a platform for these young athletes to excel, building their confidence and fostering a sense of leadership.\n\n“This is not just about volleyball; it’s about showing the world what girls from Rajouri and Poonch can achieve when given the right opportunities,” said one of the coaches involved in the program.",

		"title": "India’s Armed Forces Unite in High-Intensity Exercise ‘Poorvi Prahar’ in Arunachal Pradesh",
		"text": "New Delhi, India – The Indian Army is currently conducting a high-intensity tri-services exercise, Ex Poorvi Prahar, from 10th to 18th November 2024 in the forward areas of Arunachal Pradesh . This large-scale joint exercise, involving the Army, Navy, and Air Force, is focused on enhancing the combat effectiveness of India's armed forces in executing Integrated Joint Operations in the region's challenging mountainous terrain, with a special emphasis on improving inter-service coordination and operational readiness.\n\nEx Poorvi Prahar brings together an extensive array of cutting-edge military platforms, underscoring India’s advancements in modern warfare. The exercise features the participation of advanced fighter aircraft, reconnaissance platforms, and specialized helicopters, including the Chinook and the Advanced Light Helicopter (Rudra).

		"text": "The growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea adds new complexities to the war, making the situation in Ukraine more volatile in the coming weeks. | Image: Republic/AP\n\nKyiv, Ukraine - Approximately 8,000 North Korean troops have arrived in Russia’s western Kursk region, where they are expected to soon join the ongoing conflict against Ukraine, U.S. officials revealed on Thursday. These troops, who had only recently arrived in Russia, have undergone joint training exercises with Russian military personnel, focusing on infantry missions, artillery usage, drone operations, and trench-clearing tactics. Some of the North Korean personnel have already been equipped with Russian uniforms and military gear.\n\nWhile the troops have not yet been deployed into direct combat against Ukrainian forces, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that such an engagement is anticipated in the coming days. Speaking alongside U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and South Korean officials in Washington, Blinken confirmed the deployment's importance and its expected impact on the already strained Ukrainian defensive lines.\n\nA Fresh Challenge for Ukraine’s Defenders\n\nThe arrival of the North Korean contingent in the Kursk region is expected to place further strain on Ukraine's defenses, which are already under pressure due to Russia’s ongoing offensives. Austin reported that Russian forces are currently suffering approximately 1,250 casualties a day in their attempts to push forward, despite which, they have continued to gain ground, accelerating their territorial advances. With the introduction of North Korean troops, the Russian military is aiming to bolster its manpower, though Austin was cautious in his assessment of the effectiveness of this additional force.\n\nRussian troops at at an undisclosed location in a bunker somewhere in Ukraine. | Credit- AP\n\n“These 10,000 troops won’t come close to replacing the numbers that the Russians have lost,” Austin remarked, stressing that the high rate of casualties Russia faces means that even a large influx of troops may not significantly alter the course of the war in the long term.\n\nNorth Korea's Ongoing Military Support to Russia\n\nAlongside the troop deployment, North Korea’s assistance to Russia extends to the provision of munitions and military hardware. South Korea’s defense minister reported that North Korea has already sent hundreds of thousands of munitions and over 1,000 missiles to bolster Russia’s war efforts. In return, North Korea is likely to request advanced military technologies, including nuclear expertise, from Russia, further complicating international efforts to curb Pyongyang’s role in the conflict.\n\nIn response to the shifting battlefield dynamics, the U.S. is poised to announce additional security aid to Ukraine within the coming days, building on the over $60 billion worth of military and financial assistance already provided. While the influx of North Korean forces to the frontlines signals an escalation, U.S. officials remain hopeful that Ukraine can hold on to key positions seized earlier this year and maintain their defenses elsewhere along the front.\n\n“We remain confident in Ukraine’s ability to defend its land and hold the line, even with the current challenges,” said Austin, reinforcing the importance of continued support for the Ukrainian forces as they fend off a well-equipped and highly committed Russian adversary.\n\nChina’s Role and Diplomatic Efforts\n\nAs the U.S. continues to grapple with the implications of North Korea’s growing involvement in the conflict, Blinken reiterated the pressure being applied on China to intervene and use its influence to discourage further military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. “We have communicated our concerns with China, and we expect them to take action to curb these activities,” Blinken stated. However, he refrained from disclosing specific channels of communication with Beijing.\n\nGiven the longstanding sanctions imposed on North Korea and the lack of formal diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and Washington, the U.S. faces significant challenges in directly countering North Korea’s military assistance to Russia. The hope lies in China, as the primary regional power with influence over North Korea, to take measures that could temper Pyongyang’s involvement in the conflict.",

Once you're a public figure, your life becomes open-ended with multiple values assigned to every move that's been captured by shutterbugs, making mental health a serious topic of discussion.\n\nFamous among Europeans for starring in Sandokan, Kabir Bedi recalls reluctance he faced when he suggested Parveen Babi to seek medical help.\n\nWhen Kabir Bedi wanted Parveen Babi to receive mental health treatment?\n\nIn conversation with Digital Commentary, Bedi discussed the challenges he faced in supporting Babi as her condition worsened.\n\nBedi recalled how, after the success of his television series Sandokan, he and Babi traveled to Italy and then London, where he noticed a noticeable decline in her mental health. “I could see that her condition was getting worse,” Bedi said.\n\nConcerned, he urged Babi to seek treatment, but she resisted. “I knew that if she didn’t take treatment, her condition might deteriorate further,” he added. This tension ultimately led to their separation. Bedi clarified that it was Babi who chose to end their relationship.\n\n“She left me because she was afraid, I would force her into treatment,” Bedi said. He mentioned that individuals struggling with paranoia often fear being judged or misunderstood, especially in the public eye.

		"text": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects approximately 5 in every 1,000 people, with causes ranging from genetic factors and head injuries to underlying conditions like strokes, tumors, or infections. In some cases, the cause of epilepsy remains unknown, particularly in children. While epilepsy can often be controlled with medication, lifestyle changes play a vital role in managing the condition and reducing the risk of seizures.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological condition that affects includes seizures from mild to intense. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nSeizure types\n\nSeizures vary in intensity and duration. Mild seizures may involve a brief pause or “staring” episode, while more severe seizures can cause intense shaking, putting individuals at risk of falls and injuries. Effectively managing epilepsy involves recognizing seizure types and adjusting daily habits to minimize risks.\n\nCan these simple lifestyle tweaks help you combat the adverse effects of Epilepsy? Image credit: Pinterest\n\nLifestyle tips for managing Epilepsy\n\nAvoid triggers: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial for epilepsy management. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep each night, reducing screen time (especially exposure to flickering lights), and managing stress through yoga, meditation, or other relaxation techniques can help reduce seizure triggers. Keeping regular meal-times and eating a balanced, low-carb diet can also play a role in stabilizing brain activity and preventing seizures.\n\nDietary adjustments: Diet can significantly impact seizure frequency. The ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in carbohydrates, has been shown to be effective in reducing seizures, particularly for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. By limiting carbohydrate intake, the body enters a state of ketosis, which may help control seizures. Another beneficial diet is the low glycemic index diet, which focuses on stabilizing blood sugar levels, further reducing the likelihood of seizures.",

		"text": "High cardiorespiratory fitness can reduce the risk of dementia, a general term used to describe dip in cognitive abilities, up to 35 per cent, including in indiviuals with high genetic risk for developing ageing-related condition, as per the study.\n\nCardiorespiratory fitness or or aerobic fitness is a measure of how well oxygen is delivered to muscles and organs while performing physical activity. With age, as muscles weaken, the capacity of circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen declines. Cycling, running and aerobic exercises can help improve cardiorespiratory fitness.\n\nCycling can prove useful in improving your cardiorespiratory fitness. Image credit: Unsplash\n\nKey findings linked to dementia\n\nResearchers from Tianjin Medical University, China, and Karolinska Institute, Sweden, found that people having high scores in cardiorespiratory fitness had a higher cognitive function and a lower risk of dementia.\n\nFurther, among these individuals, onset of dementia was found to be delayed by up to 1.5 years, or 18 months.\n\n”Our study shows that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with better cognitive function and decreased dementia risk. Moreover, high cardiorespiratory fitness may buffer the impact of genetic risk of all dementia by 35 per cent,” the authors wrote in the study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\nMaintaining favourable levels of aerobic fitness could be a strategy to prevent dementia, even among people genetically inclined towards developing it, they said.\n\nFor the study, the researchers divided a group of over 61,000 people aged 39-70 years and not having dementia into three equal sub-groups according to their cardiorespiratory fitness scores. Over a follow-up period of up to 12 years, 553 people were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nThe participants took a six-minute exercise test on a stationary bike at the time of enrolling in the UK Biobank study between 2009 and 2010 for developing cardiorespiratory fitness scores.

He will also be recalled as the tennis star, who reached the numero uno spot in ATP rankings and spent the longest consecutive duration among the top ten in history.\n\nRafael Nadal bids adieu to Tennis after a two-decade long career of winning the world with his racket. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nNadal faced a string of injuries challenging his ability to perform\n\nHowever, of his over a two-decade long career came with its own sets of high and lows. Nadal has faced quite a few health setbacks ranging from abdominal pain to a hip flexor injury.\n\nIn 2023, the 'King Of Clay' faced the brunt of a hip flexor injury, which made him loss to Makie McDonald in the second round of Australian Open. He spent the entire year off-court and had a hip surgery in June.\n\nHip flexor muscles help in raise your knee towards your body, and an overuse of these muscles causes sudden strain, spasms and swelling in your hip region.

In 2022, he overcame the left foot pain with nerve-numbing injections and was declared the winner of Frech Open for the 14th time after beating Casper Ruud.\n\nFoot pain is quite common and there are number of contributors to this condition from athletic injuries, and chronic concerns like arthritis. Moreover, foot pains that are chronic in nature make it nearly impossible to conduct you daily activities.\n\nA member of the big three in the Tennis jagat (world), has reportedly complained of abdominal issues that made him pull out of Wimbledon in 2022 before the semifinals. He complained of a torn abdominal muscle.

		"text": "Whether it’s the spinning sensation of vertigo or the unsettling feeling that you’re going to topple over, it’s hard to feel like you’re in control when the room is moving faster than you are. If you've ever experienced a sudden, intense attack of dizziness, you know just how annoying—and inconvenient—it can be. You might feel nauseous, sweaty, or like you're about to face-plant into the nearest wall. But don’t worry, there's good news! While vertigo may strike unexpectedly, there are a few simple exercises you can do on your own to relieve the dizziness—no doctor’s office required (for now, at least). Let's dive into three moves that could help get you back on track and feeling steady.\n\nVertigo is not just regular dizziness. Image credit: PInterest\n\n\n\nWhat is Vertigo?\n\nFirst things first: let’s get clear on what vertigo actually is. It’s not just regular dizziness. Vertigo is a type of vestibular disorder that messes with your sense of balance. Think of it like your inner ear's GPS going haywire, causing you to feel as though you or the room around you is spinning or moving when it isn’t. It's not just an inconvenience—it can trigger nausea, vomiting, and an inability to stand up straight. Depending on what’s causing the vertigo, treatments vary, but one thing's for sure: if you can catch the dizziness early, some exercises might give you the relief you need.\n\nEpley maneuver. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nEpley maneuver\n\nIf you’ve been struck by vertigo, particularly the kind caused by BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), you might have heard about the Epley maneuver. This simple move helps to reposition the tiny crystals in your inner ear that have gone rogue and are throwing off your balance. And it works—studies show that up to 80% of people with BPPV report a significant improvement after doing this exercise.\n\nHere’s how to do it: Sit at the edge of a bed and turn your head 45 degrees towards the side where you feel the dizziness (say, to the right).\n\nQuickly lie back, keeping your head tilted at that 45-degree angle. Wait for at least 30 seconds or until the spinning stops.\n\nTurn your head slowly by 90 degrees to the left, hold for 30 seconds.\n\nNext, roll onto your left side so that your head is facing downward. Hold for another 30 seconds.\n\nFinally, sit up slowly and stay seated for a few minutes.\n\nThe goal is to return those errant crystals to their rightful place in your inner ear, stopping the dizzying sensation.\n\nBrandt-daroff exercises. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nBrandt-daroff exercises:\n\nSometimes, vertigo can come back repeatedly, leaving you feeling like you're caught in a loop of dizziness. That’s where Brandt-Daroff exercises come in. These exercises are designed to help your brain get used to the imbalance caused by vertigo, essentially “re-training” it to handle the feeling of spinning or instability. According to research, this technique is particularly effective for dealing with recurrent BPPV.\n\nHere’s how to do it: Sit on the edge of your bed and tilt your head slightly upward.\n\nLie down quickly on one side (keeping your head tilted upward), and hold that position for 30 seconds or until the dizziness fades.\n\nReturn to sitting.\n\nImmediately lie down on the opposite side, keeping your head tilted up again. Hold for 30 seconds.\n\nRepeat the sequence 5 times on each side, 2-3 times a day.\n\nOver time, these exercises help your brain adjust to the unbalanced signals it’s getting from the inner ear.\n\nGaze stabilisation exercises. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nGaze stabilisation exercises\n\nWhen your balance is off, the world around you start to look a little less steady. But with gaze stabilization exercises, you can retrain your brain to focus and keep steady on a target, even while moving. These exercises are perfect for maintaining your balance as you go about your day.",

Addressing this requires close cooperation.” “We know that climate change has disproportionate impacts on women and children,” she explained, noting how women, particularly in rural areas, face increased health risks due to continued reliance on solid fuels for cooking.\n\nShe emphasised that “access to clean energy for everyone is a priority.” This, she argued, would not only reduce health risks associated with indoor air pollution but also lessen India’s carbon footprint, marking a crucial step toward sustainable development.\n\nClimate-related health risks in India are varied, ranging from immediate effects such as respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, to long-term issues like malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural cycles.\n\nSwaminathan noted that more than 80 per cent of India’s population is now exposed to these risks, emphasizing that “everybody is now vulnerable,” from rural farmers to urban migrants.\n\nShe highlighted the specific challenges faced by the urban poor, especially migrants who live in peri-urban areas with inadequate housing and sanitation, which exposes them to greater risks during floods and extreme weather events.\n\n<i>(Climate Change. Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nWith health as a central theme, Swaminathan stressed the benefits of green public transportation, an initiative she described as a “win-win solution.” “Carbon-neutral public transport will not only reduce air pollution but also promote physical activity and thereby improve health,” she said, adding that reducing pollution would positively impact public health by curbing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nShe also highlighted that India’s urban centres are hotspots for these health issues due to dense populations and high pollution levels.\n\nSwaminathan called for policies that integrate both health and climate objectives, stressing that this approach can drive development while building resilience against climate risks.\n\n“If we do that kind of analysis, we can invest in actions that promote both development and reduce our carbon footprint,” she noted, advocating for policies that prioritise “development with a climate-resilient focus.” Examples of such integrated actions include promoting clean cooking fuels, improving access to safe drinking water, and investing in infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather.\n\nDr Swaminathan went further to advocate for a gendered approach to climate policy, urging policymakers to “put a spotlight on women but also the poorest communities.” She argued that gender equity and social equity are essential to effective climate policy, explaining that “by taking a gendered perspective in all policies, we can ensure more inclusive and effective climate action.” Swaminathan called for greater research on climate impacts that are gender-specific, noting that this data would help policymakers create more targeted, meaningful interventions.\n\nThe economic costs of climate-driven health impacts are also severe.\n\nSwaminathan pointed to recent studies indicating that climate-related air pollution alone costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually, affecting productivity, agriculture, and even tourism.\n\n“If you look at the GDP loss and workplace productivity lost due to air pollution, it’s enormous — in the trillions,” she said. This, she argued, makes climate action not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity.\n\nAddressing air pollution as a cross-border issue, Swaminathan noted that pollution does not recognise borders, making it crucial for India and other nations to engage in global collaborations.\n\n“Air pollution today is the single largest risk factor to health,” she said, adding \"It’s not a problem one country can solve on its own.” She referenced the Our Common Air (OCA) Commission, a global effort she is part of, which has been working with international bodies like WHO and UNEP to promote global standards and monitoring mechanisms for air quality.\n\n“We need a system where every country has air quality monitors and updates its data, including on super pollutants like methane and black carbon,” Swaminathan said, adding that these pollutants are highly dangerous yet often overlooked.\n\n<i>(Climate Change. Image: Pexels)</i>\n\nSwaminathan further explained the value of local data, which she argued would give a more accurate picture of pollution’s impact on different regions of India.\n\n“Policymakers want to see data from their own regions; it makes the issue real for them and helps design local solutions,” she said.\n\nReflecting on the invisible nature of pollution’s health impacts, Swaminathan commented, “When the air pollution is visible, people recognize it as a problem, but often it’s invisible, and people become accustomed to it.” She stressed that while death rates from pollution-related illnesses are often discussed, policymakers should focus on the widespread chronic illnesses caused by poor air quality.\n\n“It’s not only about death — it’s about chronic ill health that impacts quality of life and productivity,” she said, pointing out that young children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.\n\nFor Swaminathan, tackling climate change is fundamentally linked to India’s development goals.\n\n“For us, development is still a key priority,” she asserted. While India has made strides in increasing access to electricity and clean water, she stressed that much work remains, especially in rural areas where communities lack basic infrastructure.\n\nHer vision for India’s climate adaptation involves not only mitigating health risks but also ensuring that development initiatives — from housing to sanitation — are climate-resilient.\n\nSwaminathan expressed optimism about India’s potential to lead in climate adaptation through innovation, global cooperation, and commitment to sustainable development goals.",

		"title": "Indigenisation on the Waves: How the Indian Navy is Building a Self-Reliant Future",
		"text": "Over the decades, India has made strides in producing sophisticated warships, submarines, and missile systems. | Image: INS Vikrant\n\nGujarat , India: India's quest for self-sufficiency in defence is a crucial strategic initiative, especially amidst intricate geopolitics and rising maritime threats. Driven by the Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) vision, the Indian Navy's focus on indigenisation is altering India's defence and maritime security scenario. India's dependence on imported defence assets could pose a significant vulnerability because of its extensive coastline and important trade routes in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).\n\nThe Navy's dedication to domestic defence production is essential for India to become a powerful maritime force with self-sufficient defence capabilities. The Indian Navy has been on a lengthy path towards indigenisation, showcasing its strategic goal of self-sufficiency and minimising reliance on external vendors.\n\nTimeline and Summary\n\nEarly Stage (1947–1960s):\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1947, the Indian Navy depended heavily on ships constructed by the British and other nations, mainly using vessels from World War II. The establishment of Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) were key early actions in enhancing shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nInitially, the Navy concentrated on obtaining international knowledge and skills to establish its shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nIndigenous Development Initiatives (1960s–1970s):\n\nThe first ships constructed in the country were the Ajay-class Patrol Vessels, which functioned as basic patrol boats and minor war vessels. In the 1960s, the Navy started building Leander-class frigates at MDL under a UK license, constructing hulls locally and importing crucial systems to enhance shipbuilding capabilities and infrastructure.\n\nCommissioned in 1972, the INS Nilgiri represented a significant milestone in shipbuilding for India as the inaugural Leander-class frigate built in the nation.\n\nConsolidation Period (1970s–1980s):\n\nThe Godavari-class Frigates, developed in the 1980s, were India's initial domestically designed frigates, combining elements from both local and international sources, signifying a move towards greater self-reliance in ship construction.\n\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) started aiding in the advancement of naval weapons, sensors, and electronic warfare systems, such as the APSOH sonar.\n\nBroadening of Skills (1980s–1990s):\n\nThe Submarine Program involved a partnership with Germany to construct Shishumar-class submarines (Type 209/1500), successfully building two submarines at MDL and showcasing progress in local submarine manufacturing.\n\nIndia started creating more sophisticated warships like the Delhi-class destroyers, equipped with advanced radar systems and weapons, showcasing a growth in their own design expertise. Although aircraft were imported, local contributions started to enhance infrastructure and support systems.\n\nTransitioning to More Self-Reliance (1990s-2000s):\n\nThe induction of INS Delhi and its sister ships in the 1990s as part of Project 15 (Delhi-class) highlighted the capacity to produce robust naval vessels using a mix of local and foreign equipment.\n\nThe collaboration with DRDO led to the development of indigenous systems like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, which was a joint project with Russia but mainly made in India.\n\nThe Project 75 Scorpene-class submarines, a collaboration with France, aimed to construct six advanced diesel-electric submarines at MDL, enhancing technological and skills growth.\n\nThe Progress of Indigenous Shipbuilding and Naval Modernisation– (21st Century)\n\nThe Indian Navy's path to self-reliance has been highlighted by important milestones, especially in the realm of warship construction. India has achieved over 70% self-sufficiency in building warships, leading to the launch of INS Vikrant, the country's first domestically constructed aircraft carrier. By incorporating an impressive 76% local content, INS Vikrant has positioned India among a select group of nations with the capability to build an aircraft carrier, showcasing a dedication to a technologically advanced naval fleet that is domestically produced.\n\nProjects such as the Project 15B destroyers and Project 75 submarines, manufactured by Indian shipyards, emphasise this vision, with over 40 vessels currently in production at locations such as Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) along with Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL). The Make in India initiative's triumph is underscored by the reduced dependence on foreign shipbuilding facilities, signalling India's resolve to enhance its naval capabilities on its own.\n\nCore Elements of Indigenisation: Drift, Shift, and Battle\n\nThe Indian Navy's self-reliance goals are pursued through a strategy comprising three key components.\n\nThe Float Component, which represents the basic structural parts of a ship, has reached 95% localisation. The production of components like hulls and deck structures is mainly done in India, creating a solid foundation for domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe \"move\" component primarily focuses on propulsion systems and is localised to around 65%. Although India has improved its production of components like generators and water systems, it still relies on imported critical power propulsion engines. Ongoing efforts in research and development aim to close this gap and ensure the Navy's operational independence.\n\nBattle Element: This section covers combat and weapon systems crucial for contemporary warfare at a 55% localisation level. Significant progress is demonstrated by notable achievements, such as the development of the BrahMos missile locally. Nevertheless, there are still hurdles to overcome in adapting high-tech radar and missile systems to be indigenous, which are essential for India's defence sovereignty.\n\nThe BrahMos Missile Exemplifies Independence\n\nThe BrahMos missile program, one of India's most renowned Indigenous defence accomplishments, demonstrates self-reliance effectively. The approved acquisition of 200 BrahMos Extended Range missiles will strengthen the Navy's capabilities, reflecting the strategic importance of the program with a ₹19,000 crore investment.\n\nInitially started in 1998, the BrahMos project has increased its Indigenous content from 13% to 75%, engaging almost 200 Indian companies and creating around 25,000 jobs. The increased reach of the BrahMos-ER, extending to 900 km, greatly improves India's naval defence readiness, enabling accurate strikes over long distances.\n\nThe BrahMos program, despite being successful, highlights the challenges of achieving full self-reliance. Certain parts are being developed jointly with Russia, underscoring the value of strategic collaborations. Indian missile technology is set to advance significantly with future versions, such as the BrahMos-NG, which will feature a completely indigenous propulsion system.\n\nChallenges and Strategic Collaborations in Self-Sufficiency\n\nDespite significant advancements, challenges remain in certain crucial areas. Innovative partnerships are crucial for advancing propulsion systems, air defence missiles, and radar technologies. India has primarily concentrated on collaborating with foreign partners like Russia and Israel to obtain and eventually adapt advanced defence technology.\n\nPublic-private collaborations have been crucial in India's path to self-sufficiency. Partnerships with major Indian companies such as Larsen & Toubro and Tata Group are closing gaps in the local supply chain. Through these partnerships, India can decrease reliance on foreign suppliers and establish a strong foundation for advancements in vital naval components.\n\nEconomic and Strategic Impact of Self-Reliance\n\nDefence indigenisation not only contributes to strategic autonomy but also boosts economic growth. Projects like the BrahMos initiative have spurred development in more than 200 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and generated numerous skilled employment opportunities. An additional instance of the economic multiplier effect can be observed in the construction and deployment of INS Vikrant.\n\nStrengthening the defence ecosystem through a boost to the industrial sector leads to a multiplied GDP for India. Additionally, advancements from military projects are frequently utilised in civilian sectors such as electronics, AI, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nIndia is also establishing itself as a regional defence exporter through these initiatives. India's aspirations in the IOR are supported by the Navy's expanding capabilities, which aim to safeguard trade routes, foster stability, and uphold a free Indo-Pacific.\n\nIndia's Strategic Posture in the Indian Ocean Region Strengthened\n\nIndian Navy's Marine Commandos also known as MARCOS\n\nIndia's self-reliant Navy, a key player in the IOR, bolsters its position against regional threats like China's increasing naval activities. By enhancing its capabilities, India can enhance maritime security, participate in multinational exercises, and enhance diplomatic relations with regional allies. Self-sufficiency in defence is in line with national security objectives and India's larger vision of a secure and stable region, facilitating a rules-based international order that fosters global trade.\n\nLooking to 2040 and Beyond: Embracing Full Independence Through Sailing\n\nBy 2040, the Indian Navy plans to achieve total self-reliance by developing its own propulsion systems, radars, and advanced weapons. This path aligns with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, aiming to position India as a leader in cutting-edge defence technologies such as autonomous underwater vehicles and AI-based combat management systems.\n\nThe Navy's future strategy focuses on constant innovation and using advanced technology to uphold dominance at sea. Every achievement brings India a step closer to a self-reliant defence system, strengthening the Navy's capacity to safeguard national interests and promote regional stability independently.\n\nCreating a Resilient Tomorrow with Atmanirbhar Bharat",

		"title": "Pakistan Navy Day: Islamabad's Naval Fleet Still Dependent on Beijing for Survival",
		"text": "As Pakistan celebrates its Navy Day on September 8—there is an undeniable reality that clouds the commemorations: the country's heavy dependence on foreign suppliers—particularly China for its naval assets. Pakistan , despite its status as a nuclear power, continues to rely on Beijing, to modernise and maintain its naval capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, resident powers like India have significantly developed indigenous naval technologies. This stark contrast between Pakistan ’s reliance on external aid and India’s self-reliance highlights a critical vulnerability in Pakistan ’s defence strategy. The country's Navy Day offers a timely moment to reflect on the state of Pakistan’s naval forces and its broader warship shipbuilding industry.\n\nChina- Pakistan Military Cooperation: A Case Study\n\nPakistan ’s naval procurement strategy has been shaped by its close military cooperation with China in recent years. The 2021 acquisition of four Type 054A/P frigates from China is emblematic of this relationship. These frigates, equipped with modestly advanced radar systems and advanced weaponry, provide a considerable operational boost for Pakistan ’s Navy. However, the absence of substantial technology transfer from China means that Pakistan's own naval shipyards remain underdeveloped.\n\nPakistan ’s dependence on China for naval modernisation goes beyond merely acquiring vessels. This dependence extends into the broader realm of military cooperation, tying Pakistan ’s naval strategy closely to Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions. While China benefits from expanding its influence in the Indian Ocean region, Pakistan’s reliance on Chinese platforms limits its ability to independently project naval power, raising concerns about the long-term consequences of this partnership.\n\nRisks of Dependence on Foreign Aid\n\nRelying on foreign military aid, especially from China, poses significant risks for Pakistan . Should political relations between the two countries ever sour, Pakistan ’s naval operations could be severely hindered. The lack of indigenous maintenance capabilities for these advanced vessels could leave the Pakistan Navy vulnerable during a conflict or diplomatic crisis. Furthermore, this reliance on China risks compromising Pakistan’s strategic autonomy, forcing Islamabad to align its regional strategy more closely with Beijing’s interests in the Indian Ocean.\n\nWith China seeking to expand its footprint in the Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, Pakistan ’s dependence on Chinese naval platforms potentially turns it into a strategic pawn in the larger power dynamics of the region. At a time when India is emerging as a major player in the Indo-Pacific and reinforcing its own naval power, Pakistan ’s lack of indigenous capability becomes an increasingly glaring disadvantage.\n\nNaval experts are still divided on the issue of Pakistan ’s foreign military dependence. They argue that Pakistan ’s reliance on Chinese military platforms, while temporarily advantageous, ultimately compromises its strategic autonomy. During a potential crisis, this dependency could severely restrict Pakistan's operational freedom. On the other hand, some analysts defend the procurement strategy, citing financial constraints.\n\nMissed Opportunities in Naval Development\n\nPakistan has had several opportunities to build a stronger naval industry, but these have largely been squandered. Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works (KSEW), the country's premier shipbuilding facility, has long struggled with underinvestment, outdated infrastructure, and limited technical expertise. While KSEW has successfully produced smaller vessels, such as patrol boats, it lacks the capacity to build larger warships and submarines.\n\nThis inability to produce advanced naval platforms has forced Pakistan to rely on foreign suppliers, primarily China, for its fleet’s modernisation. While other nations have used foreign defence deals to acquire technology and build domestic production capacity, Pakistan has missed similar opportunities. For instance, despite receiving advanced frigates from China, little has been done to use these deals for meaningful technology transfer that could benefit Pakistan’s local shipbuilding industry.\n\nA Crying need for Reforms\n\nUndoubtedly, Pakistan ’s naval shipbuilding industry is at a crossroads. Pakistan must make substantial investments in research and development (R&D), technology transfer agreements, and domestic production capabilities to secure its maritime interests and regain strategic autonomy. This shift would reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and enable Pakistan to project any influence in the Indian Ocean let alone beyond.\n\nPolicy reforms encouraging public-private partnerships in defence production could open doors for innovation and international collaboration. Additionally, diversifying military partnerships to include nations offering meaningful technology transfer opportunities could potentially strengthen Pakistan ’s capacity to develop its own advanced naval platforms. Experts argue that with sustained investment and political will, Pakistan could develop its own frigates and submarines within a decade. However both are seen as running out as a result of constant internal issues plaguing the country.\n\nIndia’s Naval Prowess: A Stark Contrast\n\nIndia, in contrast, has proven that self-reliance in defence production is not only possible but crucial for long-term security. Through initiatives such as \"Make in India,\" the country has built a robust defence manufacturing base that includes the production of aircraft carriers, submarines, and advanced destroyers. The Kolkata-class destroyers and Vikrant-class aircraft carriers exemplify India’s commitment to reducing foreign dependence.\n\nThis focus on indigenous production has provided India with strategic autonomy and bolstered its position as a regional naval power in the Indo-Pacific. The stark difference between India’s self-reliant approach and Pakistan ’s reliance on foreign suppliers further underscores the urgency for Islamabad to rethink its naval procurement policies.\n\nA Need for Strategic Realignment\n\nAs Pakistan marks another Navy Day, the celebration should come with a clear-eyed assessment of the future. The country stands at a critical juncture: continue its reliance on foreign suppliers, or take the first steps to build a self-sufficient navy capable of safeguarding its maritime interests. For Pakistan to secure its future and regain its strategic autonomy, investment in indigenous defence production and long-term planning is essential.\n\nThe choice Pakistan makes today will shape its defence capabilities for decades to come. Will Pakistan embrace the challenge of building a truly self-reliant navy, or will it continue to depend on foreign military aid, risking its strategic autonomy at the cost of a few vessels?",

		"text": "Bronz lining. Google’s third place rank in the cloud has its an advantages. Parent Alphabet reported strong revenue growth and notched healthy operating profit in that division on Tuesday as a mooted $23 billion deal with cyber security firm Wiz evaporated. The company run by Sundar Pichai is nowhere near Microsoft and Amazon.com when it comes to remote IT data storage. But catching up has its benefits.\n\nThe cloud division notched $10 billion in revenue, a 29% increase during the three months ending June 30 compared to the same period a year ago. That beat last quarter’s rise of 28%, and was by far the fastest growing division of the company. Revenue in search and YouTube grew just above 14% and 13%, respectively. Moreover, operating income from the cloud tripled to $1.2 billion. For a company that is mainly reliant on advertising – it represents three quarters of Alphabet’s $85 billion in sales – the cloud and its prospects are the future.\n\nGoogle has had some catching up to do. It only has about 10% of market share, according to data from Canalys while Microsoft has 26% and Amazon claims 31%.\n\nBut as recent events suggest, Google has an edge as a laggard. A series of high-profile data security breaches has put Microsoft under the microscope of the U.S. government. The global outage on Friday started by an update by cyber defensive player CrowdStrike that caused the Redmond, Washington company's operating system Windows to crash illustrates the need for securing data in the cloud. But it also shows clients why they should diversify, and in some ways, Google simply benefits from others’ decisions to spread around their data.",

		"title": "RSS @100 – Looking Back, Looking Ahead",
		"text": "New Delhi: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is a unique organisational model in the world. The experiment began in 1925 with around a dozen young boys coming together to play and sing songs with a 35 year old doctor, one of the very few at that time in Nagpur. As they played, they learned about patriotism, character building, team building and lessons in brotherhood. This programme, in an open ground, was called a ‘shakha (branch)’ of RSS. This is the powerhouse of RSS and the primary measure of the organisation's growth. This has now grown to 71000 daily shakhas, 28000 weekly and about 12000 monthly gatherings.\n\nThe simple idea was to keep some time out of your day every day, beginning with one hour when you don’t think about yourself and your family, but about society. Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar had been rusticated from the school for raising the slogan of ‘Vande Mataram’ that was banned by the British, in front of the school inspector. He was not alone but organised all the senior students to defy the British order. He surrendered to the authorities when they could not break the unity forged by him and decided to punish all the students. He decided to take the punishment and not allow others to suffer.\n\n‘No Self-Interest or Self-Gratification in The Organisation’\n\nFrom there on his work with revolutionaries through 'Anushilan Samiti' while doing medicine, his work with Congress from 1918 to 1924 and his close relations with Hindu Mahasabha finally convinced him that unless Hindu society is united, reformed, and taught discipline to rise above parochialism, casteism and other divisive acts, it would be difficult to Bharatiyas to throw out the British. Even if they were thrown out, unless we had patriotic people of high character with feet firmly in Bharatiya knowledge, only the rulers would change and the citizens wouldn’t be able to realise their potential and build a healthy, prosperous society.\n\nIn his organisation, one had to improve oneself, sacrifice for the society and spend out of one’s own pocket to serve the society. There was to be no self-interest or self-gratification of any kind. Fuelled by these foundational ideas, RSS reached every nook and cranny of Bharat. Over time it created hundreds of organisations, of which 36 are national organisations.\n\nThese national and thousands of regional, district level and local level organisations have been working in every possible social and national dimension. The number of adherents of this ideology has reached crores. This does not include BJP, the political party that is closest to RSS, and working on the philosophy of Hindutva. The growth that looks so glamorous and impressive has been built on the sweat and blood of millions of unknown swayamsevaks over four generations, this being the fifth generation of swayamsevaks. Swayamsevak means a self-motivated and self-driven individual.\n\nThe biggest success of RSS is in changing the national discourse from a colonial view of Bharat and the world to a Bharat-centric world view, rooted in Bharatiya history, tradition and knowledge system. Its success in making Hindutva as the central pole of social and political discourse is a huge change in defining Bharat and Bharatiyata. The rejection of the Idea of India as a newborn nation on 15th August 1947 and acceptance of Bharat as an eternal (Sanatan) geo-cultural nation that is different from the Western concept of nation-state is the success of Hindutva.\n\n‘Hindutva Is About Our Innate Cultural Qualities’\n\nHindutva is not about religion, but about our innate cultural qualities that transcend religions and sects that we reflect in our everyday behaviour, our festivals and our pluralism. These could be termed as Hinduness. The Bharatiya idea of a nation is as old as the Vedas while the Western concept of nation state is hardly 300 years old. So, the claim of colonial intellectuals that RSS picked up the idea of the nation from the West is a refusal to look at Bharat’s history.\n\nThe church riding on the shoulders of Colonial powers, especially the British, worked hard to play on the fault lines of Bharatiya civilisation. Communists followed in their footsteps. Aryan Invasion theory, Indigenous tribals (mool nivasi) vs others (or Aryans), exploitation of tribals, Hindu dharma as an exploitative backward orthodox religion, hence conversion as a deliverance, denial of the ancient civilisational achievements as that of Hindus, hiding of its great scientific achievements or robbing them of their roots and showcasing them as achievements of others are just some of the major tools used by them to put down Bharatiya civilisation and to destroy self-respect and self-confidence.\n\nYears of efforts of RSS through its groundwork and intellectual persistence have slowly unravelled the greatness of our civilisation, our dharma and its achievements that are spread out globally. It raised the consciousness levels of the society. It nurtured an atmosphere that saw the blooming of hundreds of intellectuals who projected Bharatiya values and knowledge with solid evidence assertively.\n\nAt ground level, creating social harmony by persuading Hindu society to reform itself is an achievement. Its path has been persuasion, not confrontation. What it has brought in is not Kranti (revolution) but Sankranti (gradual change or turnaround) as defined by Swami Vivekananda. Its work in Vanvasi (tribal) areas through Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, reaching out to the remotest parts through Ekal Vidyalaya and many such initiatives has brought Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes closer to Hindu society and Bharatiya mainstream from which they were cut-off due to neglect and mechanisation of many inimical forces who do not wish to see Bharat realise its ‘Swa’ – selfhood.\n\n‘RSS Focus On Sewa, Social Harmony’\n\nThe glimpse of the renaissance of Bharat and its possibilities that we see today can be attributed to the silent work at the grassroots done by RSS. There is a sense of satisfaction in the ranks of RSS for what has been achieved. The only regret that Dr Hedgewar ji too had expressed is the speed at which it has been achieved. Could it be speeded up? There are no easy answers when one ponders over our complex civilisation. One thousand years of slavery, sustained resistance to invaders that depleted its strength, and colonisation of our minds through the British education system, and our own internal social weaknesses did not, probably, allow the velocity to be picked. Now the momentum is picking up.\n\nAs RSS expands further, objectives have been enhanced. With more and more people joining this cultural renaissance, RSS's focus on sewa, social harmony, and environmental rejuvenation has increased. Hence its training methodologies are being revised.\n\nOne can, once in a while, feel unhappy that years of work on social harmony can be disturbed easily by negativity spread by the left secular forces aided and abetted by an alliance of anti-Bharatiya forces. So, sometimes one feels that it is like ten steps forward and two steps backwards. Another regret can be the lack of legal activism which is much easier than the work on the ground. I may say that reluctance to project RSS and its allied organisations’ work is a weakness too. However, the firm faith in Bharatiyata or Hindutva overcoming such setbacks and weaknesses has kept RSS going and overcoming such odds.\n\n‘For RSS, Bharat Is A Hindu Rashtra’\n\nRSS has never assumed that it has a monopoly over social reforms and national progress. It is ready to work with other positive movements and organisations for the nation and society. It is the biggest strength of RSS earned over years of work with such forces, whom RSS defines as ‘Sajjan Shaktis’ or Well-meaning forces. Its readiness to work backstage and let others take centre stage when required has generated goodwill for it. Those who don’t share a stage anywhere else, are ready to share the common stage with RSS and its inspired organisations. It is this coming together of positive forces that will strengthen the rise of Bharat. And that is what RSS wants, not its glorification. Hence there are no ‘celebrations’ on completion of 100 years without any splits or weakening, a rarity in Bharat. There is renewed readiness to keep working for the nation, taking as many people and organisations as possible and preparing its swayamsevaks for it.",

		"title": "Bad News! 17,000 Boeing Employees Face Layoffs in Sweeping Job Cuts: Reports",
		"text": "New Delhi: Boeing Co. is set to begin notifying employees on Wednesday as it proceeds with planned job cuts aimed at increasing efficiency, reported Bloomberg. This move represents a delicate balancing act for the company, which needs to streamline its workforce without losing the skilled talent essential for boosting production levels in the future.\n\nThe company announced last month that it would be reducing its workforce by 10%, impacting approximately 17,000 jobs. These cuts are intended to help Boeing regain its competitive edge as it faces a series of challenges, including reduced output following a major incident in January and a nearly two-month strike that temporarily halted much of its production.\n\nHowever, Boeing risks compromising its recovery efforts if it cuts too deeply or from critical areas. Historically, manufacturers like Boeing could expect furloughed employees to eventually return, but the pandemic-era layoffs led to a permanent exodus of skilled engineers and mechanics—a trend that may continue as labor options broaden.\n\nWith Seattle's unemployment rate around 4% and a booming aerospace job market, Boeing workers now have more career choices than ever before. The region’s growing space sector is especially competitive for talent.\n\n\"Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin LLC, and Amazon’s Project Kuiper are actively seeking new hires to support expanding operations around Seattle, where Boeing produces most of its commercial jets,\" said Stan Shull, a consultant for the space industry with Alliance Velocity LLC. Opportunities include working on Starlink satellites with Elon Musk’s team, rockets, space stations, and lunar landers with Jeff Bezos’s company.\n\nShull estimates there are over 1,350 job openings at more than 50 space companies in the Puget Sound area, spanning roles from engineering to administrative, sales, and marketing positions.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director with AeroDynamic Advisory, highlighted the intensifying competition for skilled labor, especially as Boeing may need to resume hiring down the line. \"It works fine as long as labor markets aren't tight,\" Aboulafia commented. \"But aerospace and defense labor markets are really tight.\"\n\nLarge-scale layoffs carry additional risks. Aboulafia noted that blanket workforce reductions are \"the surest formula for losing 10% of your best people,\" who may seek greater stability elsewhere.\n\nBoeing has already felt the impact of lost expertise, particularly as it struggled to scale up production of its 737 Max jetliner. Executives later acknowledged they had underestimated the training required to bring new hires up to speed in their factories.",

		"text": "Bitcoin's value briefly crossed $93,000 due to an expectation that interest rates would be further cut down by the Fed and Trump's pro-crypto stance.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin rose nearly 6% to an all-time high of $93,462, the rise was not sustained as it dropped to $91,175 early on Thursday afternoon.\n\nLargely, however, the crypto market stays volatile.\n\nWhat Can 1 Bitcoin Buy You In India?\n\nBitcoin and any other cryptocurrency can typically be used to buy a range of products and services. Bitcoin rates have spiked recently, due to Trump's support to over $93,000. This translates approximately to Rs 78,51,831.\n\nThe amount of Rs 79,00,000 approximately comes with quite a bit of purchasing power and can afford anything starting from luxury cars, luxury watches, real estate, art, antiques, collectibles, to higher education, stock market investments, safe haven metal investments, vacations and experiences etc.\n\nHowever, the Union Budget 2022 mentions that income from cryptocurrency transactions is at a flat rate of 30%, with an additional 1% TDS on transactions exceeding Rs 50,000 annually. These are a few of the deductions that Indian cryptocurrency investors need to keep in mind while trading.\n\nWhy Is Trump Supporting Crypto?\n\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has gone from having an anti-crypto stance to being pro-crypto. he has recently turned into an investor himself.\n\nAdditionally, since Trump's victory Dogecoin - a currency backed by Elon Musk has surged 152%.\n\nElon Musk was also recently seen campaigning on behalf of Donald Trump.\n\nAn alternative for traditional money or currency, cryptocurrency has faced censure at the administrative and government level, earlier.\n\nBut recently, Trump has been more open to cryptocurrency during the presidential campaign and has ventured into trading. This has led to investors believing that the new administration, under Trump might be crypto-friendly.\n\nWhile he was campaigning for the office of US President, Trump was open to accepting donations in the form of cryptocurrency.",

		"text": "If you’ve been dreaming of a sun-soaked escape to a place that blends stunning beaches, delicious food, and a touch of colonial charm, Pondicherry is calling your name. Dubbed the 'French Riviera of the East,' this coastal gem offers everything from colourful bougainvillea-lined streets to chic boutiques, a buzzy café culture, and even some serious surf spots. Whether you’re looking to relax, indulge, or catch a wave, here’s everything you need to know about the best time to visit Pondicherry.\n\nPondicherry. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Pondicherry?\n\nLike most tropical destinations, the sweet spot for visiting Pondicherry is between October and February. During these cooler months, the weather is nothing short of perfect—think pleasant days, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C. It's prime time to lounge on the beach, stroll through Pondicherry’s historic French Quarter, or sip coffee in one of the many charming cafés.\n\nBut don’t be caught off guard! Even in winter, Pondicherry experiences occasional light showers, so pack an umbrella just in case. While this is the most comfortable period, the summer months (March to June) can be scorching hot, with temperatures pushing 42°C, making it less than ideal for sightseeing. The monsoon season from July to September brings heavy rains and high humidity, which can put a damper on outdoor activities.\n\nThe right climate to pack your bags for Pondicherry. Image credit: Pinterest\n\nPondicherry weather breakdown:\n\nOctober to February: 15°C - 30°C (Ideal for outdoor activities, sightseeing, and beach time)\n\nMarch to June: 26°C - 42°C (Scorching hot—best avoided unless you love the heat)\n\nJuly to September: 25°C - 35°C (Rainy and humid—perfect for staying cozy indoors, not so much for exploring)\n\nRainy Season in Pondicherry\n\nMonsoon season, which lasts from July to September, brings lush greenery but also heavy rain, thunderstorms, and a high risk of road closures. While the rains refresh the landscape, they can disrupt sightseeing and make getting around tricky. If you're planning a trip during this time, be prepared for delays and possibly limited access to some outdoor spots.\n\nPuducherry itinerary: How many days does it take to explore Pondy?\n\nThree to four days is the sweet spot for exploring Pondicherry. This gives you ample time to check out must-see attractions like the Shri Aurobindo Ashram, the French War Memorial, and the Old Lighthouse, as well as take a trip to Auroville, a peaceful commune just a 20-minute drive away. Don’t forget to indulge in Pondicherry’s burgeoning food scene, with standout spots like Bread & Chocolate (voted one of the top 50 restaurants in 2023), Villa Shanti, Le Dupleix, and Café Des Arts.\n\nGentle waves that throttle your surfing pace.

		"title": "Tourists Flock To Witness Unobstructed Night Sky From Mexico's Joya-La Barreta Park",
		"text": "As night descended, a rumble of frogs filled the air in this park outside the central Mexican city of Queretaro. In the sky, tiny stars appeared one by one, aligning into constellations.\n\nJuan Carlos Hernández used his weight to adjust a large telescope. “Aim for me, Rich!” he yelled to his friend. Ricardo Soriano focused a green laser on a small patch of clouds, targeting where the Tsuchinshan-Atlas comet will soon be visible.\n\nHernández and other amateur astronomers worked to certify Joya-La Barreta Ecological Park last year as the first urban night sky space in Latin America by DarkSky International, an organization working to educate the public about the harm of indiscriminate lighting.\n\nThe park sitting at about 8,520 feet (2,600 meters) above sea level on the outskirts of Queretaro gives unobstructed access to the night sky. While over 200 dark sky places exist globally, Joya-La Barreta park is only one of 11 in areas that are considered urban. Its dark sky status is under constant threat, however, from increasing light pollution and urbanization.\n\nVisitors stargazing at Joya-La Barret Park. Image credit: AP\n\nFading stars\n\nHernández, who just turned 40, has advocated relentlessly for the night sky for more than 20 years.\n\nThe president of Queretaro’s Astronomical Society and one of the founders of the stargazing tourism agency Astronite, the aerospace engineer by day has been chasing dark areas to observe the stars since he can remember.\n\n“In 2014 you could see Omega (Centauri) sitting in the sky just above the city,” he said of a constellation over 17,000 light years away. “Today it’s unimaginable.”\n\nA 2023 study that analyzed data from more than 50,000 amateur stargazers found that artificial lighting is making the night sky across the world about 10 per cent brighter each year. As of 2016, more than 80 per cent of the world lived under light-polluted skies.\n\nStudies in Mexico show that increased urbanization and the need for city lighting in relation to security issues have caused more light contamination.\n\nFernando Ávila Castro of the Institute of Astronomy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico said a good analogy to explain light pollution is noise pollution.\n\n“We constantly hear traffic noise from the street, but past a certain level that intensity becomes annoying, it doesn’t let you rest,” he said. “The same thing happens with light. Especially because all living beings have this internal clock, the circadian rhythm, which depends on the external values of light.”\n\n“When we go to sleep, we forget that an entire world remains active,” Castro said.\n\nJoya-La Barreta Ecological Park, Mexico. Image credit: AP\n\nUnder the spotlight\n\n\n\nThe moon and stars are the light source guiding nocturnal activity for plants and animals — determining when animals emerge from hiding to find food, when plants reproduce and when certain animal species migrate. Artificial light has boomed since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, with efficient, affordable LEDs the latest type in wide use.\n\n“There’s also this whole part about the biodiversity,” Analette Casazza, president of another Queretaro astronomy association, said while standing under the stars Saturday night. “We can hear the singing from all the animals that live here (in Joya-La Barreta). A lot of these pollinating animals, their activity is at night.”",

		"text": "It is well known that India possesses a “rich heritage, cultural diversity, and breathtaking destinations offering a wealth of possibilities,” as described in a statement issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB). The land of diversity is thriving in the tourism industry, emerging as a global favourite. And, recognizing the growth potential, the government has allocated ₹2,479 crore to the tourism sector for FY25.\n\nIn a recent report by the World Economic Forum, India ranked 39th among 119 countries in the latest Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024. Taking India’s global tourism to the next level, the industry is poised for continued growth. To make sure that all tourists feel welcome, the government has also launched ‘Paryatan Didi and Paryatan Mitra’ on World Tourism Day 2024 to create a hospitable and memorable experience for tourists in India. The PIB highlights improvements in three areas such as the “Prioritisation of Travel & Tourism, Safety & Security and Health & Hygiene”.\n\nWhile everyone has their own unique travel experiences, here are a few recommended destinations that give prioritization to travel and tourism, safety and security, and health and hygiene, perfect for an upcoming weekend getaway:\n\nChandigarh\n\n<i>(Chandigarh.

		"title": "US Court Dismisses Decision in Security Fraud Case Against Facebook",
		"text": "The US Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.\n\nThe justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov. 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.\n\nThe court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation. The Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks. Facebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.\n\nAt issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.\n\nFacebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment \"in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.\"\n\n\"The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,\" Stone said.\n\nFacebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialized because \"a reasonable investor\" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements. President Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook \"might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.\"\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted U.S. government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a U.S. congressional hearing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the issue.",

		"title": "Google's forced sale of Chrome could face legal hurdles",
		"text": "Efforts by US antitrust regulators to break up Alphabet by forcing a sale of its Google Chrome browser and other proposals to limit its search dominance are likely to run into legal challenges on grounds the remedies are extreme. After a ruling in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors argued to a judge on Wednesday that the company must sell Chrome, share data and search results with rivals and possibly sell its Android smartphone software.\n\nAlphabet shares closed nearly 5% lower on Thursday. The proposals are part of a landmark case aimed at reshaping how users find information. But a new pro-business administration of President-elect Donald Trump next year could change that effort and legal proceedings could last years, experts said.\n\n\"It would strike me as an over-ask,\" said Kevin Walkush at Jensen Investment Management, which holds Google stock and is skeptical a Chrome divestiture will happen. \"You ask for everything possible, not necessarily with an eye towards what would be probable and proportional, and then see what sticks.\"\n\nThe DOJ sought and won a breakup of Microsoft in the early 2000s after alleging it illegally monopolized the web browser market. That ruling was overturned by an appeals court, and Microsoft and the DOJ eventually settled.\n\nWalkush expects the Google case to take years to play out as the company appeals. \"The wheels of justice do not turn quickly,\" he said.\n\nGoogle called the DOJ's approach \"unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses,\" giving as examples diminished user privacy and less funding for companies such as browser maker Mozilla when they feature Google search.\n\nThe case could also face challenges from Trump.\n\nWhile Trump's administration originally filed the search case against Google during his first term, he indicated in October he might not break up the company because it could hurt the American tech industry at a time competition is heating up with China in areas including AI.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSUBSTANTIAL HEADWINDS\n\nChrome, the most widely used web browser, is a pillar of Google's business, providing the company with valuable user data that helps it target ads. The search ads business brought in more than half of Alphabet's total revenue of $88.3 billion in the latest quarter.\n\nThe value of Chrome, estimated to hold about two-thirds of the global browser market, diminishes sharply as a standalone browser.\n\n\"The reason why it's valuable to Google is because Google uses it to enhance its ad business and its search business,\" said Megan Gray, former general counsel at search rival DuckDuckGO who has also worked as an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission. \"If you don't have those, then Chrome would just be a data broker.\" A forced sale would not address several key issues raised in the DOJ lawsuit, including a search monopoly, critics say. U.S. antitrust enforcers, who are also pursuing Apple and Amazon in other monopoly cases, would have to approve any potential Chrome buyer.\n\n\"DOJ will face substantial headwinds with this remedy,\" because Chrome can run search engines other than Google, said Gus Hurwitz, senior fellow and academic director at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. \"Courts expect any remedy to have a causal connection to the underlying antitrust concern. Divesting Chrome does absolutely nothing to address this concern.\"\n\nThe DOJ proposed a blanket ban on Google offering incentives to give its search engine preferential treatment. That would include Google's lucrative partnership with Apple, where it pays the smartphone maker billions of dollars annually to make Google Search the default on Apple smartphones.\n\nEvercore analysts called the proposed curbs \"draconian.\"\n\nGiven Google Search's popularity, Apple is likely to continue with Google as the default search engine even without any agreement or payments, Hurwitz said.\n\nDOJ's proposals also include demands for Google to license search results at a nominal cost and share the user data it gathers with competitors for free.",

		"text": "Alphabet's Google must sell its Chrome browser, share data and search results with rivals and take other measures - including possibly selling Android - to end its monopoly on online search, prosecutors argued to a judge on Wednesday.\n\nThe measures presented by the Department of Justice are part of a landmark case in Washington which has the potential to reshape how users find information.\n\nThey would be in place for up to a decade, enforced via a court-appointed committee to remedy what the judge overseeing the case deemed an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising in the US, where Google processes 90% of searches.\n\n\"Google's unlawful behavior has deprived rivals not only of critical distribution channels but also distribution partners who could otherwise enable entry into these markets by competitors in new and innovative ways,\" the DOJ and state antitrust enforcers said in a court filing on Wednesday.\n\nTheir proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make its search engine the default on their tablets and smartphones.\n\nGoogle called the proposals staggering in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"DOJ's approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses - and jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it's needed most,\" said Alphabet Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker.\n\nAlphabet shares closed nearly 5% lower on Thursday.\n\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April, though President-elect Donald Trump and the DOJ's next antitrust head could step in and change course in the case.\n\nTECHNICAL COMMITTEE\n\nThe proposals are wide-ranging, including barring Google from re-entering the browser market for five years and insisting Google sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition. The DOJ has also requested a prohibition on Google buying or investing in search rivals, query-based artificial intelligence products or advertising technology.\n\nPublishers and websites would also be given a way to opt out of being included in training Google's AI products.\n\nA five-person technical committee appointed by the judge would enforce compliance under prosecutors' proposals. The committee, which Google would pay for, would have the power to demand documents, interview employees and delve into software code, the filing showed.\n\nThe measures together are meant to break \"a perpetual feedback loop that further entrenches Google\" through additional users, data and advertising dollars, prosecutors said.\n\nCHROME AND ANDROID\n\nChrome is the world's most widely used web browser and is a pillar of Google's business, providing user information that helps the company target ads more effectively and profitably.\n\nGoogle has used Chrome and Android to preference its own search engine to the detriment of rivals, prosecutors said.\n\nGoogle has said making it divest Chrome and Android, which are built on open source code and are free, would harm companies that have built upon them to develop their own products.\n\nThe proposals would bar Google from requiring devices that run on Android to include its search or AI products.\n\nGoogle would have the option to sell the software off in lieu of compliance. The DOJ and state antitrust enforcers would have to approve any potential buyers.\n\nGoogle will have a chance to present its own proposals in December.\n\nDATA SHARING\n\nGoogle would be required under the proposals to license search results to competitors at nominal cost and share data it gathers from users with competitors for free. It would be barred from collecting any user data that it cannot share because of privacy concerns.\n\nProsecutors crafted the proposals after speaking with companies that compete with Google, including search engine DuckDuckGo.\n\n\"We think this is a really big deal and will lower the barriers to competition,\" said Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's head of public affairs.",

OpenAI has already entered the search market with SearchGPT.\n\nGoogle-owner Alphabet has been trying to boost its AI heft since ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, answering back with its own generative AI chatbot, Gemini, last year.\n\nGoogle's dominance in the browser market became precarious after the U.S. Department of Justice argued that the company should sell its Chrome browser to end its monopoly on online search.\n\nOpenAI has also discussed powering artificial intelligence features on Samsung-made devices, a key business partner of Google, the Information report said, citing people who were briefed about the situation.\n\nThe company already has a partnership with Apple, whereby the iPhone maker's \"Apple Intelligence\" features on new devices are powered using the technology from OpenAI. The Information report, however, said OpenAI is not remotely close to launching a browser.\n\nGoogle, OpenAI and Samsung did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nChatGPT takes on Google Search\n\nThe information comes almost a month after OpenAI announced ChatGPT Search to take on Google Search.

		"title": "Anushka Sharma, Sanjana Ganesan's Reaction Viral As India Break Australia's Frustrating 10th-Wicket Stand. Watch",
		"text": "India are dominating Australia in the first Test. Captain Jasprit Bumrah picked a dazzling 5-30 as India secured a handy 46-run lead at lunch on day two of first Test after bowling out Australia for 104 in 51.2 overs at Perth Stadium on Saturday. It is also the third lowest-score for Australia in Tests at home since 2000. In the morning, resuming form 67/7, India looked certain to end the innings early, but Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood frustrated them with a dogged last-wicket stand of 25 off 110 balls, as they were able to keep the deficit below 50 runs. Apart from Bumrah, debutant all-rounder Harshit Rana finished with 3-48.\n\nAfter the last-wicket stand was broken India were relieved. In the stands, actor and Virat Kohli's wife Anushka Sharma along with Sanjana Ganesan, sports anchor and Jasprit Bumrah's wife, heaved a sigh of relief. Their reaction has gone viral.\n\nLiterally all of us after that Starc wicket\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/ysJQOZOIId — Pallavi Anand (@PallaviSAnand) November 23, 2024\n\nIndia had a fantastic start to day two's play, thanks to Bumrah striking on his first ball of the day to complete his 11th five-wicket haul in Tests, as he got Alex Carey to nick behind. Harshit Rana got the reward for his banging into the pitch deliveries as Nathan Lyon was cramped for room and his well-directed short ball took the glove edge to slip cordon.\n\nBumrah could have got his sixth wicket in Hazlewood if the wrong-footed Rishabh Pant had made a dive in time to take a catch. From there, Starc was solid in his defence and resorted to strike-rotation to fetch important runs for Australia, despite being hit once on the helmet by Rana.\n\nIt also helped the last-wicket pair of Starc and Hazlewood that the seam movement of the ball went down after 40 overs, thus aiding them more in getting crucial runs. The duo held their ground well to stitch a stand of 25 runs off 110 balls, the highest partnership in this innings for Australia.\n\nBut just before lunch break, Rana had Starc miscuing a slog to Pant to dismiss him for 26 off 112 balls and secure a handy lead for India, who would now aim to take the upper hand in this frenetic Test match by putting in a better batting performance in their second innings.\n\nBrief Scores: India 150 in 49.4 overs lead Australia 104 in 51.2 overs (Mitchell Starc 26, Alex Carey 21; Jasprit Bumrah 5-30, Harshit Rana 3-48) by 46 runs\n\nWith IANS inputs",

		"text": "Sunil Gavaskar, former Indian cricket team skipper, is absolutely angry with a 'fake' article that has been published in his name. In the article titled, \"A New Era in Leadership: Bumrah's Captaincy and Kohli's Leadership Revive Team India\" it is written how the pacer's leadership skills and the former captain's assistance helped India dominate Australia in Perth. In the article, it is also written, that Rohit Sharma's absence in the first Test \"is a blessing in disguise\" for Indian cricket and whether the \"selectors and management need to rethink the leadership dynamics\".\n\nNow, Gavaskar, in a video, has quashed the article as being a fake one and demanded apology.\n\n\"Hi, this is Sunil Gavaskar and I want to say that there is a website cricket ception which has printed an article under my name. I have to say that that is completely fake, I have not contributed that at all and I want to tell that website to take it down immediately.\"\n\n\"Issue an apology. If you don't do that immediately, I will give the matter to my legal team. So don't believe a word of what you've read, this is a completely fake article and attributed to me.\"\n\nSunny G clarified that this is a fake article and has asked the website to remove the article and apologize otherwise he will ask his legal team to look into the matter. https://t.co/t5irxQXywl pic.twitter.com/SlfZn0Ka7e — Dhaval Patel (@CricCrazy0) November 23, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, on Day 1 of the 1st India vs Australia Test in Perth, Gavaskar refused to mince his words and reminded everyone of the 900 wickets that Ravichandran Ashwin and Jadeja have between them in Tests during his commentary stint on Day 1.\n\n\"Really surprised with Ashwin and Jadeja not playing, they have got 900 wickets between them in Test matches. They are not bowlers who can just play in Indian or sub-continent conditions. They are very clever bowlers, they are very experienced bowlers. Even if they might not get you wickets, they will be able to slow the scoring down because of the cleverness of how they bowl,\" said Gavaskar on-air.",

		"text": "What To Know About A Storm Bringing High Winds, Heavy Rain, Snow To California And Pacific Northwest | Image: AP\n\nSan Francisco: One of the strongest storms on the West Coast in decades knocked out power for thousands of people, unleashed strong winds that toppled trees and left two dead in Washington before making its way through Oregon to Northern California where on Thursday it dropped heavy snow and record amounts of rain.\n\nThe National Weather Service extended a flood watch into Saturday for areas north of San Francisco as the region was inundated by the strongest atmospheric river — a long and wide plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land — so far this season. The storm system roared ashore Tuesday as a “bomb cyclone,” which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly, and it’s expected to bring moderate to heavy rain through Saturday, increasing the risk of flash flooding and rockslides, forecasters said.\n\nHere Are Some Things To Know About The Storm:\n\nStrong Winds Bring Power Outages And Topple Trees\n\nAbout 285,000 homes and businesses remain without power Thursday in Washington, where falling trees struck homes and littered roads across the western portion of the state, killing at least two people. One woman in Lynnwood died when a large tree fell on a homeless encampment, while another woman in Bellevue was killed when a tree fell on a home.\n\nCities began opening warming centers offering free internet and device charging. In the hardest hit areas east of Seattle, power wasn’t expected to be fully restored until midday Saturday, Puget Sound Energy said. At least a dozen schools were closed in the Seattle area Wednesday and some opted to extend those closures through Thursday. In Enumclaw, east of Seattle, residents were cleaning up after their town clocked the highest winds in the state on Tuesday night: 74 mph (119 kph).\n\nMeanwhile, in Northern California, there were reports of power outages Thursday affecting more than 20,000 customers. Several districts in Sonoma County closed their schools Thursday due to the storm, county officials said.\n\nOfficials Warn Of Hazardous Travel Conditions\n\nAbout 150 flights were delayed and another two dozen were canceled Thursday at San Francisco International Airport, after hundreds were delayed and dozens were canceled on Wednesday, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. Transportation officials shut down a 2-mile (3.2 kilometer) stretch of Northern California’s famed Avenue of the Giants, a scenic drive named for the towering coast redwoods along the route, due to flooding. The National Weather Service warned road travel conditions would be hazardous in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n“The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday evening and Monday morning commutes as roads become slick and snow covered,” the service said. “Gusty winds could bring down tree branches.” A winter storm watch was in place for the northern Sierra Nevada above 3,500 feet (1,100 meters), where 15 inches (38 cm) of snow was possible over two days. Wind gusts could top 75 mph (120 kph) in mountain areas, forecasters said.\n\nMaggie Eshbaugh, marketing manager at Sugar Bowl Resort, northwest of Lake Tahoe, said about a foot (30 centimeters) of snow fell there Wednesday night. She said they’re excited to welcome customers Friday, which is the earliest the ski resort has opened in 20 years. Interstate 5 was closed for an 11-mile (18-kilometer) stretch from Ashland, Oregon, to the California border on Wednesday morning due to extreme winter weather conditions in Northern California, according to the Oregon Department of Transportation. It was reopened by Wednesday night.\n\nThe storm also caused some damage on State Highway 6 near Oregon’s coast but it seemed to largely spare the state where no major damage was reported as of Thursday.\n\nRain And Snow Could Linger Into Next Week\n\nA second, lighter wave of the storm is expected Saturday through Tuesday in Northern California, said meteorologist Courtney Carpenter, with the National Weather Service Sacramento. It will bring lighter rain in the lower elevations, but heavier mountain snow that will reach lower levels than the first wave, she said.\n\nDangerous flash flooding, rockslides and debris flows were possible, especially where hillsides were loosened by recent wildfires, officials warned. Scott Rowe, a hydrologist with the weather service in Sacramento, said so far the ground has been able to absorb the rain in California’s Butte and Tehama counties where the Park Fire burned over the summer.",

I haven’t seen anything like this,” Trish Bloor, a city of Issaquah official, said while surveying damaged homes.\n\nUp to 16 inches (about 41 centimeters) of rain was forecast in southwestern Oregon and California's northern counties through Friday.\n\nSanta Rosa saw 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain in the last 24 hours, marking the wettest day on record since 1998.\n\nThe Sonoma County Airport, in the wine country north of San Francisco, got more than 11 inches (28 centimeters) within the last 48 hours and the unincorporated town of Venado had about 12.7 inches (32.3 centimeters) in the same period.\n\nMeghan Nelson, her fiancé and their corgi had to escape to a hotel Thursday after their home’s basement and the street it’s on in Fulton, California, flooded. She said they moved their belongings upstairs and put their furniture on bricks, but they don't know if they’ll be able to get back tomorrow if there’s more rain.\n\n“Luckily we’re safe for right now. So that’s a good thing,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Forestville, one person was hurt when a tree fell on a house. Small landslides were reported across the North Bay, including one on State Route 281 on Wednesday that caused a car crash.\n\nDaniela Alvarado said calls to her and her father’s Sonoma County-based tree business have nearly tripled in recent days, with people reaching out about trimming or removing trees.\n\n“We feel sad, scared, but also ready for action,” Alvarado said.\n\nRain slowed somewhat, but “persistent heavy rain will enter the picture again by Friday morning,” the weather service said. “We are not done!”\n\nFlash flooding, rockslides and debris flows were possible, especially where hillsides were loosened by recent wildfires, officials warned. Scott Rowe, a hydrologist with the weather service in Sacramento, said so far the ground has been able to absorb the rain in areas where the Park Fire burned this summer.\n\n“It’s not necessarily how much rain falls; it’s how fast the rain falls,” Rowe said.\n\nSanta Rosa Division Chief Fire Marshal Paul Lowenthal said 100 vehicles were stuck for hours in the parking lot of a hotel and medical center after being swamped by thigh-high waters from a flooded creek.\n\nA winter storm watch was in place for the northern Sierra Nevada above 3,500 feet (1,070 meters), with 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow possible over two days. Wind gusts could top 75 mph (121 kph) in mountain areas, forecasters said.\n\nSugar Bowl Resort, north of Lake Tahoe near Donner Summit, picked up a foot (30 centimeters) of snow overnight, marketing manager Maggie Eshbaugh said Thursday. She said the resort will welcome skiers and boarders on Friday, the earliest opening date in 20 years, “and then we’re going to get another whopping of another foot or so on Saturday, so this is fantastic.”\n\nAnother popular resort, Palisades Tahoe, said it is also opening Friday, five days ahead of schedule.\n\nThe storm already dumped more than a foot of snow along the Cascades in Oregon by Wednesday night, according to the weather service.\n\nMore than a dozen schools closed in the Seattle area Wednesday, and some opted to extend the closures through Thursday.\n\nCovington Medical Center southeast of Seattle postponed elective surgeries and diverted ambulances after losing power and having to rely on generators Tuesday night into Wednesday, according to Scott Thompson, spokesperson for MultiCare Health System. Nearby MultiCare clinics closed Wednesday and Thursday after losing power.\n\nBen Gibbard, lead singer of the indie rock bands Death Cab for Cutie and Postal Service, drove from his Seattle neighborhood Thursday morning to the woods of Tiger Mountain for his regular weekday run, but trees were blocking the trail.\n\n“We didn’t get hit that hard in the city,” he said. “I just didn’t assume it would be this kind of situation out here. Obviously you feel the most for people who had their homes partially destroyed by this.”\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee thanked utility crews for toiling around the clock. It could take weeks to assess the scope of the damage and put a dollar figure on it, he said in a statement, and after that “we’ll know whether we will be able to seek federal assistance.”\n\nIn California, there were reports of more than 8,000 power outages.\n\nAuthorities limited vehicle traffic on part of northbound Interstate 5 between Redding and Yreka due to snow, according to California's Department of Transportation. Officials also shut down a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) stretch of the scenic Avenue of the Giants, named for its towering coast redwoods, due to flooding.\n\nAbout 550 flights were delayed and dozens were canceled Thursday at San Francisco International Airport, according to tracking service FlightAware.\n\nThe Northeast, meanwhile, got a much-needed shot of precipitation, providing a bit of respite in a region plagued by wildfires and dwindling water supplies. More than 2 inches (5 centimeters) was expected by Saturday morning north of New York City, with snow mixed in at higher elevations.\n\nWeather service meteorologist Brian Ciemnecki in New York City, which this week saw its first drought warning in 22 years, said “any rainfall is going to be significant” but the storm won't be enough to end the drought.",

		"title": "Emperor Penguin Released at Sea 20 Days After Waddling Onto Australian Beach",
		"text": "Melbourne: The only emperor penguin known to have swum from Antarctica to Australia was released at sea 20 days after he waddled ashore on a popular tourist beach, officials said Friday.\n\nThe adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia — about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.\n\nThe boat traveled for several hours from the state’s most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn’t give the distance in its statement.\n\nHe had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.\n\n“I really didn’t know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,” Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird’s release but released by the government on Friday.\n\n“I’ll miss Gus. It’s been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn’t have missed,” she added.\n\nBiddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.\n\n“He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They’re social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,” she said.\n\nGus gained weight in her care, from 21.3 kilograms (47 pounds) when he was found to 24.7 kilograms (54 pounds). He stands 1 meter (39 inches) tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds).\n\nThe largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is further south than Western Australia.\n\nThe government said with the Southern Hemisphere summer approaching, it had been time-crucial to return Gus to the ocean where he could thermoregulate.",

		"title": "Troubling Process Error: US Rejects ICC Arrest Warrant for Israel PM Netanyahu as Gaza War Rages On",
		"text": "Tel Aviv: The United States on Friday rejected the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who are accused of ‘crimes against humanity and war crimes’\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed concern over the decision in a press briefing, and stated that, \"We fundamentally reject the court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials.\" She further criticised the haste by the prosecutor in seeking the warrants and pointed out troubling process errors that led to the outcome.\n\nJean-Pierre also added that the United States has been clear about the ICC's lack of jurisdiction over this matter. \"Whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no evidence, none between Israel and Hamas, there's just none,\" she said. The White House is working closely with its partners, including Israel, to discuss the next steps. Jean-Pierre reaffirmed, “We fundamentally reject that the ICC has jurisdiction over the situation, and so that's something that we've been pretty clear about and we'll continue to.”\n\nThis statement comes as the US continues to show support for Israel amid the ICC's charges against its leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, the ICC in The Hague on Thursday issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, accusing them of \"crimes against humanity and war crimes.\" The charges include allegations of targeting civilians and enforcing policies of starvation in Gaza.\n\nThe International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials.\n\nIt accuses them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu condemned the ICC's decision in a statement on his social media platform, calling it \"antisemitic\" and comparing it to the infamous Dreyfus trial. In a video posted on his X handle, Netanyahu said, \"The antisemitic decision of the international court in The Hague is a modern Dreyfus trial, and it will end the same way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNetanyahu drew parallels between his situation and the false treason charges against French Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus over 130 years ago. Referring to Emile Zola's famous essay J'accuse, which defended Dreyfus, Netanyahu said, \"Now an international court in The Hague, also headed by a French judge, is repeating this outrageous offence. It is falsely accusing me and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant of deliberately targeting civilians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe defended Israel's military actions in Gaza, claiming that the measures implemented were necessary to minimise civilian casualties. \"We issue millions of text messages, phone calls, and leaflets to warn the citizens of Gaza to get out of harm's way, while Hamas terrorists do everything in their power to keep them in harm's way, including using them as human shields,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetanyahu dismissed accusations of imposing a starvation policy, highlighting that Israel had supplied 700,000 tons of food to Gaza. He stated, \"We've supplied Gaza with 700,000 tons of food to feed the people of Gaza. That's 3,200 calories for every man, woman, and child in Gaza. And these supplies are routinely looted by Hamas terrorists, who deprive their people of much-needed food.\" He also noted that Israel had facilitated the vaccination of 97 percent of Gaza's population against polio. Netanyahu called the ICC's charges baseless, asking, “What in God's name are they talking about in The Hague?”\n\nThe Israeli Prime Minister further criticised the ICC for focusing on Israel while ignoring war crimes in countries like Iran, Syria, and Yemen. He also denounced the court for its failure to act against Hamas, describing their atrocities during the recent Gaza conflict. \"No biassed anti-Israel decision in The Hague will prevent the State of Israel from defending its citizens,\" Netanyahu asserted.\n\nHe thanked allies, particularly the United States, for condemning the ICC's move and reiterated that Israel does not recognize the court's jurisdiction. The Israeli PM said, “We will continue to do everything we must to defend our citizens and defend our state against Iran's Axis of terror, which includes Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and others.”\n\n\"Our enemies are your enemies, and our victory will be your victory--the victory of civilization over barbarism and tyranny,\" Netanyahu added.",

		"title": "Putin Touts Russia’s New Hypersonic Missile, Warns West for Supporting Ukraine With Weapons",
		"text": "Moscow: Russia launched a ballistic missile towards Ukrainian city of Dnipro as the Russia-Ukraine War rages on and hours after the missile attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed the missile launch in a sudden TV appearance, describing the missile and warning the West against supporting Ukraine.\n\nDid Russia Launch Missile Attack on Ukraine? Putin Issues Statement\n\nThe new ballistic missile fired by Russia struck a military-industrial facility in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, but its real mission was delivering a deadly new message to NATO.\n\nHours after Thursday’s strike touched off a debate over whether the Ukrainian plant was hit by an intercontinental ballistic missile, President Vladimir Putin made a rare and surprise appearance on Russian television to clear up the mystery.\n\nHe described it as a new, intermediate-range ballistic missile that raced to its target at 10 times the speed of sound.\n\n“Modern air defense systems that exist in the world and anti-missile defenses created by the Americans in Europe can’t intercept such missiles,” Putin declared in an icy and menacing tone. The attack marked the first time that such a missile was used in the war — or in any conflict.\n\nThe dramatic events came in a week of soaring tensions as Ukraine struck targets in Russia with American-made longer-range missiles after the U.S. eased restrictions on their use and Putin responded by lowering the threshold for using Moscow’s nuclear arsenal.\n\nRussian Missile Attacks Dnipro in Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force reported tracking the ICBM launch, along with six other missiles, all of which targeted the Dnipro region. The missiles were launched in rapid succession from Russia’s Astrahan region, starting at around 5 a.m., Ukrainian military officials said.\n\nUkraine’s military stated that six of the missiles were intercepted, but the one they believe was an ICBM struck a site in Dnipro. Officials reported no casualties or significant damage from the attack, which appeared to target businesses and critical infrastructure.\n\n“We are 95% sure it was an ICBM,” a Ukrainian official told ABC News. However, they noted that investigators were still analyzing missile fragments and had not yet reached a definitive conclusion.\n\nAll About ‘Oreshnik’, Missile Launched By Russia\n\nPutin said the missile was called “Oreshnik,” which in Russian means “hazelnut tree,” and that this first combat test of it “has gone successfully.”\n\nHe said in July that Russia would start producing intermediate-range missiles to “mirror” U.S. plans to deploy such weapons. In his speech Thursday, he said Russia developed Oreshnik in response to the U.S. development and deployment of missiles with a similar range.\n\nIntermediate-range missiles, or IRBMs, can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Ukrainian military officials said the missile was launched from the Russian region of Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea, 800 kilometers (500 miles) to the east.\n\nWhile Russia has launched cruise missiles at Ukraine from even longer ranges, the new intermediate range missile marked the first such use of this kind of ground-launched ballistic missile, which can carry a much heavier conventional payload and could also be fitted with multiple nuclear warheads.\n\nPutin boasted that the missile, the latest in Russia’s arsenal of hypersonic weapons, reaches its target at speeds of Mach 10, rendering Western missile defenses useless. Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, noted that the missile used Thursday has a range “way beyond any of that seen in this conflict so far and possibly the first ever use in combat.”\n\nHe said the missile was capable of releasing multiple warheads at extremely high speeds, even though they are less accurate than cruise missiles or short-range ballistic missiles. Video of the strike showed six fiery trails followed by powerful explosions -– an apparent sign of the multiple warheads being used. The authenticity of the videos couldn’t be independently confirmed.\n\nAs for Putin’s claim that the Western systems could not intercept the missile, Savill said “these are quite hard to defend against” even for advanced U.S. Patriot systems. “You’re dropping multiple independently targetable warheads, MIRVs, at extremely high speed, so even Patriot will struggle to basically intercept those,” he said.\n\n‘Do You Really Want to Take That Risk?': Putin Warns the West\n\nPutin has described Thursday’s use of the Oreshnik as a response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian military facilities in Bryansk and Kursk regions earlier this week with Western-supplied weapons.\n\nOne of those strikes killed and wounded an unspecified number of Russian servicemen, which the Kremlin leader said added “elements of a global character” to the conflict. Putin has warned previously that use of the Western weapons would mean that Russia and NATO are at war.\n\n“We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,” he said. “And in case of escalation of aggressive actions we will respond resolutely in a mirror way.”\n\nIf Russia launches more strikes on Ukraine with the new missile, it will warn of its use in advance to allow civilians to reach safety as a “humanitarian” gesture, Putin said, adding that Moscow isn’t worried about tipping off the enemy since it cannot stop the attack.\n\n“I would recommend the ruling elites of the countries that are hatching plans to use their military contingents against Russia to seriously think about it,” Putin said.\n\nSavill said the new missile is sending a fear-inducing signal from Russia that “we’ve got stuff that outrages you.”\n\nThe larger message to the West is that “we’re happy to enter into a competition around intermediate-range ballistic missiles. P.S. These could be nuclear tipped. Do you really want to take that risk?’”\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council that is chaired by Putin, stepped up the rhetoric by posting a video of the missile attack on Ukraine and chastising the West. “So, that’s what you wanted? Well, you’ve damn well got it! A hypersonic ballistic missile attack,” he posted on X.\n\nUkraine and the West Condemn Russian Attack\n\nIn a speech to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the attack and accused Moscow of using Ukraine as a testing ground for its new weapon.\n\n“Today, our insane neighbor has once again shown what they truly are, and how they despise dignity, freedom, and human life itself. And how terrified they are,” he said.\n\nTwo U.S. officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive matter and thus spoke on condition of anonymity said Russia only has a few of this type of experimental missile in its possession and it is not a capability that is expected to be regularly deployed against Ukraine.\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told lawmakers that the war was at “a serious moment,” and “the front line is now less stable than at any time” since the conflict began. “We have seen in recent weeks a very clear escalation from Putin and his forces,” he said. “They have stepped up attacks on the energy system in Ukraine ahead of winter, they have stepped up attacks on civilian centers killing children, they have deployed at least 10,000 North Korean troops to the battle front line.”",
